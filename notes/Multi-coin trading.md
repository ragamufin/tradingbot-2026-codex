The idea here is to have a trading strategy but instead of trading one coin, trade 2 (or more) and allow for switching between the coins based on their strength against each other and the dollar

* One of the following actions can be taken:
1. long
2. short
3. switch

For example:

* ( c1 > $ ) && ( c1 > c2 ) => long c1
* ( c1 < $ ) && ( c1 < c2 ) => short c1



  coin 1			coin 2	
> $ 					√				√
