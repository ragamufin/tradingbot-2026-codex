### Overview
* Buy something like CREAM with spot. It has high funding and longs consistently pay shorts
* Short it on the perps to get the funding
* Once enough funding accumulated based on some algorithm, buy more CREAM and short the same amount
* Possible variations
  * Once critical mass on both sides in reached add some or all of the funding to buy actual coins, especially in bearish dumps in bullish trends or in a sort of grid system
* If switch from longs paying shorts to shorts paying longs then clear both sides and take up another coin if any
