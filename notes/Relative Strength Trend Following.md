### Strategy
The idea here is to have a basic trend following strategy across a basket of assets. We segregate into the strong and the weak and we stay in the strong while shorting the weak when they are bearish
* We have a shortlist of assets we want to keep and that provide cross collateral margin, let's say BTC, ETH, SOL, HYPE
* We keep our funds not in $ but in the assets in the shortlist providing collateral 
* We keep a list of shit assets, things that generally go down over time. We can just use the trend following stats and the ones that perform the worst against it would be at the top of our shit list
* When any of keepers are bullish, we take out shorts at highs on the others in the shit list. We do this cautiously as these ones can and do pump hard at times. We try to get to a full coverage but only adding in as it goes our way, bit by bit
* If the shitty one fires a bullish signal, we start swapping the short on it over to others in the shit list that are still bearish
* If the strong goes bearish, we keep our shorts on the weak while they are still bearish
* Also, the shorts don't have to be 100% covering the underlying. They can be partial and only added to over time to build up a strong position. Like this, they can even go more than 100% with careful risk management. We could even use the profits in the shorts as a buffer to make short term momentum plays or market making mean reversion plays
### Thesis
Over time this should result in 
* Being exposed to the upside from the keepers
* Shielded from the downside by the shorts on the weak
* Profits muted somewhat by the shorts on the weak when things are pumping. However it shouldn't be too much if they really are bearish according to the trend following strategy. Over time, it should make for increased profits across the board
* Less losses due to chop, in fact, probably a profit. The strong will go in and out of bullish/bearish but even if we get a bullish signal that ultimately goes bearish at a lower price, the constant short on the weaker ones should offset that, ideally gaining a profit
* A substantial *yield* over the long term from the spread and the profitability of the trend following strategy
* This would be a way to just do trend following but downplay its cons, in fact, turning the cons into pros i.e. chop/false starts and not giving back so much from trending moves due to the fact that the weak will give back more. The one con remaining is that on trending moves down, at the bottom, the weak tend to pump way harder than the strong. Still, they fall so far that even with a kick, yes I'm giving back some but really I'm still up because I'm basically out of the market plus have shorts
