* What would have happened had you left the trade as is and let it hit your stop rather than fussing with it?
* How am I screwing up my winners?
* How much of the opportunity am I genuinely capturing vs how much I could?
* MAE. How far do your trades go offsides before they make money?
* Is there one of my strategies that perform better than the others?
* How can I lose less money from my losers?
* How many trades am I missing?
* Keep track of canceled trades
* Find the consistently losing traders (instead of the winners which are fewer) and study them. Do the opposite of their recommendations.

  * They’re treating this as a job, making money each month or hire someone to do it
  * Longs **and** Shorts
  * Automated trading
  * Playing only a few coins, if even more than one at a time
    * They aren’t hodling a lot of coins for some eventual payday. They hodl a few choice coins, a few meaning a very fucking few.
  * Accumulating like mad when a coin is super low **over time**
  * Selling on super highs
