Since most people lose $, split funds to some large number and trade automatically against the majority. 

* Say a moving average, keep track of the average or median depth of its waves. Whenever above the median, start selling out 1% of inventory for every 1% rise. Buy on the reverse when below the average or median.
* The ultimate test would be if this works on a low time frame, low % moves, lower length moving average
* A moving average doesn’t quite tell you market sentiment or volatility does it? Seems more it would be to start scaling into the market when sentiment is low or sell volume, selling interest increases and scaling out when open interest, buy volume (market orders), starts to increase
