After all my strategy building and trading, here’s what I’ve learned:

* Trading price naked directionally is a borderline fools game
* Better to trade:
  * Relative strength
  * Market Making. 
    * Smaller positions, closing them at target, carrying them at loss if covered or closing at wide stops. This flips R:R and win ratio importance seeing as how the market moves in waves and more often than not pretty much any trade will hit target if given time and room. In the end R:R actually is good given that most trades would reach target.
  * Spreads, Cash and Carry
  * Funding
  * Volatility
  * Momentum
* Use varied stops instead of fixed distance
* Don’t trade bullish and bearish price action the same way
  * Need to identify specifically the differences between the two
  * Shorts have unlimited upside risk. Longs (or spot positions) get sticky as the price drops and have limited downside risk but unlimited profit potential
* Focus on R:R over win ratio. Mastering this is the most direct route to massive gains
  * You want as much reward for as little risk over a series of trades. This is the metric to really ramp up. All along you’ve felt that if you can get a great win-ratio then you can bet the moon on each trade, confident that since most win then you’ll be killing it. Not true at all. If each trade is only really traveling a small distance and your stop is well off then the few times your stop is hit results in a loss that wipes out a number of those wins. It looks nice on screen doesn’t it? Win, win, win, loss, win. However if that loss is 2% and each of those 4 wins was just a 0.5% on average, then you broke even. Add in fees and well, you lost money, though on the looks of it, you were killing it. Focus, on R:R. It is better to have a 40% win rate with a 1:3 R:R than a 70% win rate with 1:1. In the latter, let’s say you risk $1 on each of 10 trades. You win 7, so you make $7, you lose 3, so you lose $3 which means in total you made $7 - $3 = $4. In the former: 4 * $3 = $12 won. 6 * $1 = $6 lost. $12 - $6 = $6 total gained. Over the 10 trades, $6 > $4 and so the 40% win rate + 1:3 R:R > 70% win rate with 1:1 R:R.
  * Profit targets vs stop loss
  * If you’re 100% up and sell half then you get back your initial investment and can let the rest ride free and clear. This is a big deal. Doing this with just the amount you risk on each trade, selling half once you’ve gain double the risk taken, it is worth investigating and testing.
* Use varied profit targets instead of fixed distance
* Cut trades before stop is hit, take profit before target, when you see specific market conditions occurring. 
  * Getting out of losing trades quicker improves R:R. Some of these trades may have turned into winners so try to figure out clear and specific conditions when you should do this. My guess is though that more often than not, cutting the losers even quicker would result in a more robust and profitable trading system. Sometimes cutting a trade short results in finding a better entry, you took a loss but rather than having kept the original trade and sitting a loss waiting for it to hit target after it just skirted your stop loss, you end up in profit from the get-go, maybe with a different stop even. The more in loss you are the farther price has to travel to make it to target, meaning, the less the probability of it. So don’t sit in losses too often, especially large ones, there is an opportunity cost there plus the probability of the trade working out has dropped. Try to be green more. Better to get out, then get back in at a worse price but once it appears that the price is actually now on its way.
  * Taking profits sooner can negatively impact R:R however the trick here is that your profits are most in jeopardy just before they hit target. You could go from 1:1.9 to 1:0 on that trade so again, depending on specific market conditions, it is worth considering. You can always simply just take some off
* It’s much easier, simpler and lucrative to trade a larger time frame with wider stops giving you time to be right. 
  * Most of the trades you are stopped out of, damn near all of them, come back and pass that point not very long after. So trying to squeeze out profit when you want it isn’t smart. Better to trade a system that takes advantage of this fact.
  * The market moves in waves. It is indistinguishable from randomness, patterns are overrated in that pattern failure is quite costly. It’s not the amount of $ you *can* make on a trade that matters, it’s how much you stand to lose if you are wrong that should be the primary concern and focus.
* You can:
  * trade larger for smaller gains more frequently. Unless there is a momentous move against you, more often than not you hit target. The problem here is that those losses can be costly and wipe the whole system out.
  * trader smaller for more modest gains. This results in winning more consistently and has lower risk.
  * trade smaller for smaller gains frequently. It marries the two above in that it gives you the consistency and has lower risk. The risk is not so much lower though as you will have closer profit targets and smaller wins so the wide stops consequently mean you are shooting for a lower R:R to begin with.
  * Straying from one of these paths is one of the top ways to be a losing trader, specifically because you don’t have consistency and/or lose big too often
* Being in the market all the time is a fool’s errand unless you are covered and/or you are getting paid to be in the market such as by funding or volatility decay
* Adding to position is a really hard thing to get right. Better to bet bigger plus scale out and backtest that than to add to position as you jeopardize a winning position. However, if used frugally, not as a way to milk more out of profitable trades but when the market appears to be on the verge of a big move, then it may be fine to shoot for the moon and use existing unrealized profit to capture much much larger gains. Emphasis on much, that would be the only reason to do this. Getting this wrong too often, and it doesn’t take much for it to be often, blows up your R:R and can undo lots of wins turning you into a loser.
* The most important thing is risk management. Second to that is money management i.e. preserving capital
  * You are a risk manager, not a trader. Making $ should be a byproduct of managing risk, not trying to make money and tacking on risk management to it.
  * The randomness of the market means that in any given situation, pretty much anything can happen. Probability is overrated, if there is a 1 in 100 chance you can blow up, assume you will blow up and start first at making sure that is as unlikely to happen as you can.
  * You must undertake risk in order to make any money but filtering the amount and type of risk to take plus when to take it, makes a colossal difference in pnl.
  * Playing on the black swan events, while rare, is quite lucrative. It’s not a bad idea to wait for and bet  big after a massive drop or blow off the few times you see them clearly occurring.
  * How often have you not seen this? Market blasts off incredibly and day after day is roaring away. Then boom, a massive counter move that last no time only to steadily revert. This is why there is no need to fomo, there are usually great chances to get back in and these chances come often enough, where the market drops from its new high to below most of its recent gains for a short while that they are worth trading plus watching out for in terms of not giving up profits or getting washed out only to watch things come back right to where they started
  * Focusing first and foremost on a strategy that inherently mitigates risk will not only make money but is simpler, easier to manage and understand. Such a strategy isn’t thrown off by spikes and large wicks, it rolls with them.
* Hurry up and wait. A systematic system is all fine and well but there is a rhythm to each market. It ebbs and flows, is moody at times, chilled at others, volatile the next. Becoming familiar with the moods of the market and being able not so much to time them but to probe them with low risk, is something you don’t read about much (it was in Reminiscences of a Stock Operator) nor have realized is a skill. It’s something you do already without knowing so best to be conscious of it and train it.
* Most of the time the market does a whole lot of nothing. So, why trade for when the market is roaring? Wouldn’t it make sense to take advantage of the conditions where the market does nothing, since that is what it mostly does? This could mean of course some sort of range trading, mean reversion, market making etc. However it also means strategies to collect funding, options or move contracts, etc. as well. These can even be combined with each other or another strategy for when the market is moving. Something like market making or range trading but keeping a modest position open when the market starts to trend, resuming the market making / range trading once things settle down again.
* There is something to be said about trading on a macro level like a hedge fund. Think - build into a position. Trading over an extended period of time. Take a small position long, let’s say. Wait for a run up, close off with a short. Wait for the inevitable quick and hard pullback that looks like it’s all over and add small to your long. Wait and don’t add to the short until you are well clear of the long. If it goes down before that, adjust, cover, add small again way lower. The idea here is to build into a sizable position using time to your advantage. Do it with the trend, getting more longs close to your original and shorts higher and higher, closing them out on the deep pullbacks. It could be done with a strong vs weak asset. It could be done directionally, the sky is the limit but the point here is to let the market play out long enough to give you better entries and going in small enough that you can suffer any loss building size on top of an already existing profitable and ideally covered position.

### Types of trading ranked by risk (low to high):
This can be evaluated by simply asking the question: what would happen in the worse case scenario or some kind of black swan event occurs?
1. Spreads, Cash and Carry
2. Funding
3. Market Making
4. Relative Strength
5. Volatility
6. Momentum

### Types of trading ranked by possible gains:
1. Volatility
2. Momentum
3. Relative Strength
4. Funding
5. Market Making
6. Spreads, Cash and Carry

* Obviously the two lists are almost inverses of each other. 
* However there is a shuffle up in the middle which says something. 
  * Volatility plays have lower risk yet higher gain than momentum
  * Spreads, Cash and Carry have the lowest risk yet lowest gains making them the most conservative strategy. This is a good thing in its own way because you gain consistency and yet can increase gains by betting bigger due to the lower risk. Not too big however as the risk can be non-linear.
  * Funding is 2 in terms of low risk yet not second to last in terms of gains which means it has a good R:R
  * Market making is 3 in terms low risk but second to last in terms of gains meaning it has a smaller R:R potential overall. This makes it a less desirable strategy. Add to that the fact that it tends to be a high frequency trading system which means complexity and fees and we can rule this out as a strategy
  * Relative strength is 4 in terms of low risk but 3 in terms of gains meaning it has lower R:R as you incur greater risk than the other strategies in order to make its gains which are lesser than the others
* Also combining two (or more) types may yield the best of both worlds
* Looking at all these combos, it would appear that volatility and funding are the sweet spot. This would hint at fishing for positions when volatility is low trying to be deep on the right side of an eventual breakout, riding the eventual spike in volatility if things go your way and then taking counter positions that offer funding as volatility begins to slow down or decent profit targets are hit. Using the profit contained in the spread to build and ever larger and larger position and spread thus reducing risk and increasing funding

### Main Takeaways
* Low risk strategy
* Benefit from what the market does mostly: nothing
* Relative strength is a super secret weapon
* Maximize R:R. Never have fixed stops / profit targets
* Cut losses shorter than the stop
* Take profit before target / exit trade
* That quick, massive counter trend move is almost an inevitability
* Sell half on the double?
* In the randomness one consistent pattern: waves. In all aspects, **price**, **volatility**, volume, time,  sentiment, etc.
* Only add to position in order to risk it all for a much much larger gain
* decide wether to go larger for small gains, small for modest gains or small for small gains or a mix depending on market factors
* build into a position
