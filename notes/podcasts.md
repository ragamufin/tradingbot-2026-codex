* Time isn't a thing. The speed of price through time is the only time time matters
* Time variable profiles / Market profile
* A successful trader needs to see things differently quickly. You may not be able to see this on a bar chart
* If the price of something is so low that so many people want to buy it, it moves away from there quickly. And if the price of something is too high, it moves away from there quickly. Leaving a tail. Which means the true opportunity at the low is a finger snap, and the true opportunity at the high is a finger snap. Which means that if you think that something is the low and you buy and it gives you a second chance, it means it's not the low and if you sell something at the high and it comes back there, it's a pretty good chance it's not the high. In trading you never want a second chance at something

* You buy a call and short the underlying. The call serves as a hedge or stop or sorts and allows you to sleep at night plus you don't have a stop that gets hit then the market goes the other way. You have time to be right. You can then patiently build the short position. If you're right you will **lose** on the hedge but gain on the directional position. Your goal would be to make as much on the short by expiration than the premium paid for the call. You have a plethora of ways to parlay this along the way into other types of risk profiles. Say you hit a point of profit on the short more than the premium paid. Depending on market conditions and time to expiration you can now close the short and ride out the call. Or roll the call. Or sell another call. Plus you can manage the position using the delta of the call option

Just remember how you spent ~$3.7k on 350 sol contracts call. If you had shorted ~ 350 sol at the same time. By the time it drops $20, your short is 20*350 = $7,000. Profit -> $7,000 - $3.7k. You can keep this position open till expiration even, since you could even use your sol as collateral and this would be a way to keep value on the downside, make $ actually but be covered on the upside, the call covering the short, using delta to offload some of the short even but you have sol as collateral which is gaining to the upside

* 3:30 minute mark. Don't think about the money

If you think about it, I get tight when I think about how much $ I can lose, how much $ I can gain. However if I focussed on it just as a rubik's cube, as something like the gym where I'm trying to improve my application, then I would be much much loser, because I wouldn't be trapped by thoughts of what if this happens, what if that happens, laden with the consequent emotions. Instead I would think about the what ifs as a puzzle to navigate and then be able to see clearer paths through the ruff
* 25 minute mark. Society teaches us how to win, to want to be winners. No one teaches you how to lose and how to lose is extremely important in life and in trading. Do you lose and then get bogged down and swallowed up or do you deal with it, learn from it, reflect on it constructively and **move on**? Sports teaches you how to lose. Think about how badly Borussia is doing right now and Avantura Osaka is probably doing ok. It burns to think about and I have to be at peace with that somehow and keep positive

Stop looking at your pnl so often. It holds you back. Builds up emotional pressure. Focus on your strategy and plan, points of interest, set alerts, review periodically versus constantly feeding at the dopamine trough. Wouldn't you do better? In fact, you've been doing that more and more through the years and look, you **have** done so much better. Remember the days of nodding off at the computer watching every pip move on btc, the anguish, the noise and myopia. My God. And now, you make more $ doing less and having an easier go of it. The chart doesn't move when you're watching it. That's my own saying there and it's a good one eh, conveys so much, like water doesn't boil if you watch it ->
**The chart doesn't move if you watch it**
Watching your pnl, is like checking yourself out in the mirror every day to see if you gained muscle, lost weight. You won't see anything but the fact that you could be doing better. Step away and check once a month and suddenly you become aware of your actual gains, or lack thereof

* Another one from me -> Focus on the shot after this one and the one after that, chess principle
* minute 45. It's easy to go from the 20 yard line to the 30. It's almost impossible to go from the 20 yard line to scoring a touch down. Get noticeably better here and now at the little $ and don't worry about hitting it big

That goes for work too, building some super profitable project, just build and get something going that has some value and iterate, add. One step at a time, define not the end goal but the next great step towards achieving the ultimate goal and figure out how to get there, how to measure getting there and keep your eye on that local prize

* minute 4:50. The aim of analysis to Identify where you know others will buy after you and where you know others will sell after you
* minute 8:30. Take your temperature -> Why did I just do that, where and what state am I in right now

From me. You don't have everything algorithmic. For instance for your put/call strategy. You could focus on the math of it and coming up with the formulas to calculate risk and points of profit. So that when ready you look at the price of the option, days to expiry, etc. and plug it in to your prebuilt formulas to get an output of the plan, the amounts to enter and where to take profit, risk-lose graph, etc. That would be easier to do and doubles as a way to validate the strategy. Also, remember, forget the $ and focus on the game

* minute 45:40. What are some of the ways you can apply this concept of stretch targets? 
  * Start with a blank slate. What are my goals and how do I do this? And where do I have leverage? The classic ones could be time and effort. What if I traded new time zones, partnered with someone, trade more products, speak to someone who's been in my shoes before, **ask others, what would you do if you were me?** etc. Really go back to first principles, stop narrowing yourself simply down to how to I write code to trade crypto. First principles. **How you spend your days, is everything** How are you spending your days?

* 26 minute mark. Look for the game where you have a relative edge. If you're at the poker table with all these young kids that know all the solvers by heart and 2 tables over is a different style of poker with ladies from the old folks home, maybe you should be playing that instead. What are computers and algorithms not good at for instance, maybe play in those areas. Think about AD cornering the CHIP market. Think about you being a top player at Suminoe futsal or a ladies man in Japan

Top Traders Uplugged - S193: Nothing but Trend Following ft. Jerry Parker
They mention the following quote in regards to say running several parameters for the same strategy in order to "diversify" performance by markets:
> A truth that applies to almost every field is that it’s possible to try too hard, and when doing so you can get worse results than those who knew less, cared less, and put in less effort than you did

Excellent returns for a few years is not nearly as powerful as pretty good returns for a long time and few things can beat average returns sustained for a very long time

So don't get too bogged down in some complicated crazy system that requires immense effort and resources in order to function if you can find a few simpler more straightforward things where the profitability of it is closer to a guarantee than not, where you can apply it across different things easily, diversify it, combine it with things like farming, etc. in order to juice returns in low risk / delta neutral ways. Simplicity trumps complete. Get up running sooner and making $.

He realized that a lot of his markets were correlated, he's trading 200 markets. So instead he removed 15 markets and doubled up his position sizing on a few of the ones that were least correlated. Then he was reminded of the fact that his thesis is chasing outliers and not "diversification". So he undid this change. He then added 100 more equities to his list of markets to trade, he had always said he doesn't want to have more equities than commodities but then again he reminded himself: he's chasing outliers, not diversification so he added them anyway
Interesting as this is a longstanding worry I have with crypto as well since the whole market moves together and alts seem to just be betas of btc. However, that might be a good thing, in that my job could be chasing the outliers. In fact, that was kind of the point of the relative strength dev work I've been doing, I'm trying to chase outliers, in fact I'm totally ok going down with the market if in doing so I'm in the strongest coins and going back up I'm in the strongest ones. Something to think about because it might fine tune the/a trading strategy idea if I make sure I'm completely clear, that the goal is catching outliers

With a cross-sectional momentum (relative strength) based strategy, the idea is that if something has been going strong then it will continue to do so. However for trend following we generally don't like to make such an assumption but instead allocate across multiple markets treating them all the same. Some of those outliers caught, there are things like "endogenous events", etc. there is less information about why they become outliers. You end up buying past winners and leaving a lot of $ on the table. Better to keep it simple
I guess the simple test of this is to test it right? If I do moment based tests, does it catch outliers better than a trend following strategy? Is it worth trading both to complement each other? Is it possible combine them into 1, a regime filter and then choose the most momentous once the regime changes?

### Derek Wong - How to think about strategies like a quant and diversify like a boss
https://podcasts.apple.com/jp/podcast/chat-with-traders/id957265404?l=en
* Your goal should be to reduce personal volatility, i.e. smooth our your returns across strategies by systemizing as much as you can, removing yourself as much as possible out of the equation so that your quirks and inadequacies don't show up in your pnl
* Each strategy has its own chart when you think about it. You can trade that chart as if the entire strategy is just one asset. So trade multiple strategies just as you would multiple assets, diversify and trade over the strategy level versus at the individual asset level. Imagine the abstraction of applying a trend following strategy not to a basket of assets but to a basket of strategies, jumping in the ones that are trending
* Along the lines of the previous point, diversification is paramount. Don't go for the basket of strategies that make you the most money but rather the ones that complement each other in such a way where they can mitigate each other's losses and even accentuate each other's gains
* Synthetic data. Just randomly generating a large price series and testing your trading strategy against that to begin with. Cuts out curve fitting and really nails down risk management before you get to the point of introducing the hidden quirks of a real price series. Something worth thinking about

* Adaptive strategies. Parameters should adapt so that the strategy auto changes over time. However they shouldn't be wildly fluctuating
* Diversification of systems across different time frames. So that each asset is a portfolio in itself

* minute 49. Think of getting your strategy out in the market asap as an MVP. You want to see it working and gather data sooner rather than later. You can always change it and add the things you want to but once you have an MVP, quit fiddling with it and get it out into the market with real $. Then fiddle if you want and as you observe it you will learn things you just don't in back-testing. Just think about your own experience manually trading with some loose strategy in mind. Instead of having that time be a distraction, something like this becomes a more constructive distraction, you have similar emotions but since you are letting the strategy handle your funds, you become hyper focussed on dissecting and improving that strategy while using your learnings about trading so far, your patience, etc. to keep it simple and resilient
