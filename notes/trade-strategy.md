### Strategy 1 - Trend trading
- [ ] Need a strong indicators for trend and momentum
- [ ] On a momentous upward trend buy and sell on the opposite
- [ ] From the buy price have a certain percentage of gains before which no selling. After the gains percentage has been reached then:
  - [ ] sell when indicators signal a downward turn

OR
- [ ] sell when price drops below x percentage (stop loss)
- [ ] Once sold then buy again on upward indicator
- [ ] have stop loss cut off losses
- [ ] move stop as price increases (trailing stop loss)

#### When to buy / sell
* We want to trade with the trend so being able to identify the trend is of the utmost importance. The more accurately we can identify that the market is trending or is about to and ideally on a strong trend the better
1. Using a combination of indicators. Primarily the DMI ADX indicator as this gives us a plethora of info to wade through to determine the trend, strength of the trend as well as changes in the trend.
2. Using the above with a stochastic oscillator. The stochastic oscillator is pretty good at identify buy/sell points. It does however cause one to lose money in a sideways moving market. We can avoid that using a range or we can use it with the above ADX (possibly with DMI as well) to help to avoid trades in sideways markets or use all of them together.
3. Another strategy is to use the Heikin Ashi. I’ve long since noticed that this chart is pretty good at showing the trend of a trade and I’ve been thinking isn’t it a no-brainer to just trade based on this? Buy on green, sell on red. The problem is reversals and such but using one of the other things mentioned here even that can be avoided. Identify the trend after getting a green Heikin Ashi candle stick, maybe the strength of the move, buy, don’t trade within the range, etc. Looking into the “Octavia strategy” now which appears to be based on this and may give me just the data I need!

4. Similar to the above use a Renko chart as it does well at capturing trend. Buy on green, sell on any red and set the price move for each block to an appropriate amount covering the free and making an acceptable minimum profit which can be set to the range of movement we want to allow in the price for sideways markets, say 2% of price for instance. One could combine this with the data from a Heikin Ashi chart and/or any of the other methods.
	1. If the Renko chart isn’t painting new bars then it means the market isn’t moving out of our range so these
5. For Heikin Ashi/Renko chart trading consider using a moving / exponential moving average. This will be based on price movement **not** time and so will probably be an even easier signal for when to get in a trade or out of it since it will smoothen the noise and help you avoid exiting long moves just because of some retracement if that move was powerful. It will also take into account how several a falling trend was before a rising one so that you don’t jump into what appears to be a rising trend when it is only a retracement before continuing down.
6. This last part of this article shows combining Heikin Ashi with ADX
7. Decide based on a relatively large time frame but then compare with the smaller time frame to see if the trend exists and is picking up steam or dissipating.
8. Weighting different criteria and indicators can be used to come up with a score of how strong a buy/sell we have at a given point and in so doing be able to pick strong trades only across various pairs
9. Consider not betting the entire pot at once but instead breaking up into parts and buying in at several points. This may seem counter-intuitive because you’re lessening the profit you would make if you put it in all at once and it goes your way. However consider that if you get a buy signal and put in 1/3rd of the pot in then check again after an elapsed time if the trade is going your way then put the next 1/3rd in and so forth. The advantage of this is if the trade does not go your way, you’d be out with a loss of on 1/3 or 2/3rds of the total you can put in. A form of risk management. The same can be done on selling as well, sell only 1/3rd, wait for the next tick/block and sell the next 1/3rd (or rest) if the trade is still going against you. If it has reversed then you still have 1/3 or 2/3rds riding on it. Doing this gets you fully invested only in trades going your way for sure, probably the trades that are actually mooning versus just a temporary run.
	1. Is there a way to dollar cost average into the same trade somehow? Some kind of condition where the price decreases but hasn’t pushed you out of the trade and you add more of the batches in. In a trending chart that you are already bought into, on retracement that doesn’t blow you out of the trade that then reverses back into the right direction of the trend then load another batch in.
10. I may not have to replicate a Renko chart of most indicators, just using the data they are providing can give me a strategy since all data is based on price, time and volume anyway. I could say simply see how much money would be made based on my available funds on each asset over the last time frame and enter the one that made the most money. Exit once it gets out of a range and the price retraces x percent and look for the next trade. Momentum can be determined by subdividing the time frame and seeing if price is increasing faster or slower in order to weigh one trade more desirable than another.
	1. Whatever rules you come up with, they should be able to work for just one asset to determine when to buy/sell that one asset and not rely on picking one out of a group.
	2. You could determine the strength of a move by using the moving average and checking its slope to make sure it is above a certain threshold.
	3. I suppose it is possible for something to just keep floating up slowly, we either do not care about these or using weights we can make sure that if something floats up long enough that it gets greater weight.
	4. Possibly weight the market cap moving average/renko chart. Separate coins between high market cap and low. For high cap coins weigh the highly if trending. For low cap coins weigh the trend highly if high, medium if sideways and low if trending down
11. A way to do shorts in order to hedge? When the trade turns against you before good profit then open a short that you close when the trend changes back your way, that way you’ve basically moved your original entry down. Could I do this somehow by selling half of what I bought and buying it back when the trend resumes. What’s the math on this?
	1. Shorts also would allow us to look for strong short possibilities and take the strongest trades whether or not they are longs or shorts
12. Consider using the recent trade history as an indicator.  An order will not be executed except if a taker comes and buys_sells matching orders in the bids_asks. So if the recent order history is a sea of buys then we can assume the price is rising. If it’s a sea of sells then it’s falling. Confirm with price and we get a pretty good momentum indicator. **<= GREAT IDEA**
13. Maybe keep a rating on each coin based on past trades to weigh it greater on future trades if decent profit was made, adjust the rating with time and subsequent trades appropriately so that an asset that performed once well doesn’t automatically stay at the top
14. Maybe tracking percentage change in price of coins over each period such as every day_3 days_week and weight that as a factor in which coins to choose/switch to. There has to be a way to track the strength of a coin throughout the market in terms of price and track them over time to see the movers bubbling up and get into them. A more holistic method of balancing and rebalancing a portfolio based on the movement of coins.
15. Possible to do this on an exchange that allows for doing shorts as well so we can using the same logic for opening/closing long **and** short positions

### Strategy 2 - Compare and Contrast
We can use any of the tools in other strategies however this strategy relies on pretending as if we had a position in all the assets available.
* Mock buy in to all available assets and over a period of time see how each does and actually buy into the one performing best.
* Possibly give the amount of money made one weight and the acceleration of price increase a slightly greater weight in order to choose which one to get into
* Exit using one of the other ideas such as if it retraces a certain amount or if momentum of price slows. This can be coupled with if another asset is found performing increasingly better we can exit the current one and enter the other.
* Exiting can also be done under the flip of the conditions for entering, amount of money being made goes negative by a certain amount and price decrease momentum is greater then exit. Acceleration of momentum in this case would be weighted slightly lesser than money made. Remember money made is different from the price move itself, if you have $500 in btc, losing $20 would probably correlate to a larger move in the price of btc than $20. Let’s say btc costs $9000 and we are investing $900 then that is 10% of the price of btc. So in order to lose $20 btc would have to fall by $200.
* After exiting, find the next best performing one.
* When do you zero out the history?
  * Maybe keep history over the last x frames and dropping out the oldest one
* Actually this strategy does not have to rely on comparing against other assets in a group and can be used on one asset. Only keeping track of how much money would be made in the last x frames and the momentum of price change you can time entries to when those weighted values are favorable even on one asset.
* In terms of splitting the pot into batches, for this strategy we simply on each tick, invest the next fraction of the pot into the asset that is at that time the best amongst the buys. This may or may not result in more funds going into the same asset. For exit signals we exit with the batch and wait for the next tick in order to exit the remaining batch.
  * If we have more than 1 batch invested in an asset and we exit on sell signal then on the subsequent tick if we still have a sell signal then exit all the rest.
  * A (trailing) stop loss can still be used to make sure we don’t overstay our welcome.
  * Splitting position size this way where different batches could end up on different assets is also a great way of diversifying. Whereas before I was thinking to have different instances with their own pots that each go totally into one asset each I can have instead one pot and split it investing in batches in such a way that all the batches could end up in one asset or split up across the best performing assets.
* Retest strategy. This involves tracking highs and lows and whenever the asset makes a subsequent low and starts to go up if the low is higher than the previous low and the previous high is higher than the one before it then buy. Exit if the new high is not higher than the previous high and/or use a trailing stop. Vice-versa if it makes subsequent high lower than the previous high and the previous low is lower than the one before then enter a short. Exit if the next low is not lower than the previous low or trailing stop is triggered. For buy add to position on every subsequent higher lower preceded by a higher high. For shorts add on every subsequent lower high preceded by a lower low.
* Consider using ATR
  * Could set the range within which not to do any trades. Hmm, not sure if this makes sense.
  * Could be used instead of specifying a hard $20 but instead combined with the pot itself to come up with a number based on a fraction of the daily range. So say 20% of the daily range then worked out to how much that results in for the pot being used.
* Check stop losses over several time frames so that you can avoid wicks

### Strategy 3 - Market cap
A strategy based on the overall market. Buying when the market changes from down to up and selling when it changes from up to down
* Maybe use market cap increase/decrease by a certain amount and momentum
* Possibly use instead or in addition, a cumulative score of all the assets change in price of a certain period
* Buy when market trend changes upward
* Need a way to figure out which assets to buy when the trend changes
  * first movers?
  * lowest of a filtered set of strong coins
  * use some indicators
  * check price movement_momentum_trend across the coins and pick the best ones
* average into trades
* Sell
  * If trailing stop loss triggers
  * and / or if market trend reverses
    * in this case consider making trailing stop losses tighter after the trend changes

### Trailing buy / sell
#### Sell order
* s% = small %
* l% = large %
  - [ ] have trailing stop at s% to sell if it goes down to protect from losses
  - [ ] if it goes up by l% then continually move the stop to l% - s% as the price reaches new highs

#### Buy order
* ap = acceptable price
* s% = small %
  - [ ] once the price falls to ap buy if it comes back up to ap + s%
  - [ ] as the price keeps making new lows move the ap to the new low

---## Summary of options
### Goals
* Price likely to increase
* Price likely to keep increasing
* Maximize profits
* Minimize loss
* Favor larger profit even if it means way fewer trades vs smaller profits with many trades
* Even if in profit, switch to better trade opportunities when comparatively the upside is much greater after a minimum amount of time

### What do we need to know
* Will the price increase from here?
* Will the increase be sustained and valuable?
* Will the price decrease?
* Will this decrease be just a stepping stone towards greater profit or we going to be coughing up a lot of the unrealized profit we’ve had?
* Based on the answers to these questions:
  * Which coins are good buys right now?
  * Which open positions should we close?
  * Should we close an open position in order to open a position in a better buy?

### Indicators
* Stochastic crossover
* DMI
* ADX
* RSI
* Slope on EMA or MA
* Ratio of buys to sells in order history
* Track if we mock bought into each in the recent past and how it would have performed in terms of our goals such as momentum of price increase and percentage price increase
* Renko chart to indicate trend and actual meaningful price moves
* Heikin Ashi chart to indicate trend by smoothing out insignificant variations in closing prices
* Multiple time frames
* Spread between asks and bids. This can have a (exponential) moving average that tells us how aggressively the market moving.  Narrow spreads indicate aggressive momentum versus wide spreads indicate a slow market. Coupled with the direction and momentum price change it could be a powerful secret weapon. Volume can also be added.
* Volume, VWAP
* Track when buy/sell walls are eaten through
* Track liquidations. When people are liquidated the market is usually making a big move contra to the sentiments of a lot of people.

### What data do we need
* Momentum
* Trend
* How likely are all the above to continue
* Indication of strong trend reversal?
  * Well, no problem with buying in the middle of an existing trend so long as the trend is showing strength to continue so maybe it’s important to get in on a upward trend that so far shows accelerating price increase?
  * Accelerating price increase can be shown by breaking the time frame into smaller time frames and comparing the price increase momentum of the group. Say 3 snapshots and 3 > 2 > 1
  * If doing accelerating price increase then it’s important to take into amount of the price increase. If the price increase is accelerating but from really slow to slow to a little less slow then we are not interested. We want fast to faster to really fast. A slow trending increase means it will take time to make profits and time is $ in automated trading, especially when we don’t have to settle for it since we can theoretically make any trade anywhere. 8000.01 to 8000.02 then to 8000.04 then to 8000.08 is an accelerating price increase but relatively speaking, the price isn’t moving at all. So we have to figure out our minimum percent increase that constitutes a unit of increase.
  * We would also have to weigh how much the momentum change is meaning that 3 > 2 > 1 is acceleration but if it’s increasing by a tiny amount on top of our minimum percent then it’s not accelerating very much.
* So based on the above, do accelerating minimum percentage price change?

### Random Thoughts
* Could judge things using a mish-mash of technical indicators and price action **or** try to use price action and time (maybe also the order book history) to see if the conditions are already what we want leading up to now and accelerating.

All TA indicators are basically from price action, time and volume so do we need to use any actual indicators or do we just calculate the current state of affairs and compare over time.
* Actually the above 2 things aren’t all that different and not what I want to say. I’m thinking to simply track an asset to see if it price increases by certain amounts in an accelerating fashion over a given time frame. Just using that isn’t it enough to come up with a score?
* Other things can be added in such as whether or not the market cap is sideways or trending
* Scores can be kept for the success/failure of past trades on a coin or conditions in order to sort of “learn”. Not sure about this though.
* The score for if the current conditions are favorable can be compared to a score for all the other coins and picking the best amongst all those above a certain threshold would be the ticket.
* So, the idea then is to work backwards. I’ve been sort of mid-brained in my approach, thinking indicators tell me some secrets to the market. Does RSI really reveal any secret that once you look at its formula you won’t get the idea and can incorporate that in a more intuitive straightforward manner?
* Why not then imagine in real life, how would I trade, how do I trade, what would be successful trading. I’ve got charts but I know a thing or two about the coins. There are events, news, there is a “reputation” of certain coins. There is volume, some coins get more volume than others and in any given day a coin could suddenly see more traffic which is usually an indication of it going up or down relatively quickly/consistently. Shake out of the box, think beyond charts, you have access to the data, come from the successful trade and work backwards to find what data points exist along the way and how they change. Ahhh… now we’re on to something. Indicators may certainly come into play but they’ll be just to do metrics between coins since there are already defined and tested formulas but simple is often best. And it would be much simpler to buy a coin that starts out at a certain percent of volume in the market and price and then moves up over 2 ticks each time increasing volume (or maintaining the previous high volume) and price appreciably. It’s ranking in terms of price percentage increase (and maybe volume) in the list of coins would push it up the list a peg or two. The ones climbing up are the ones we want. Get in and with smart risk management, get out if the guess was wrong.
* So with this, it would be rather simple and rely primarily on comparison between coins, establishing a minimum threshold or what’s acceptable and having smart risk management strategies to minimize loss or turn it into profit if  we pick wrong. Just the hard part is to think backwards. What a fun challenge! It’s 2018, we have apis and all kinds of data, do we really need a “chart” centric approach? The chart is a representation of the data points and it does it brilliantly but perhaps when we start deciphering the chart we are a step too removed from the obvious. Like Heikin-Ashi charts show clearly that there are trends. We don’t really need a chart to show it if we understand the underlying concept. The underlying concept may be better captured if we think from a completely different angle.
* Next up, it seems support and resistance might be a way to go. When something breaks either it usually goes on a run and might be the time to trade. There are some smart ways I could come up with to identify support and resistance in coin’s activity. First figure out if it’s a smart way to trade then figure out how to do it.
* Renko chart do appear to be the way to go as they have most if not all we need in them then coupled with time could prove to be just the ticket. An upward block indicates a trend with a move of appreciable price change and the percentage price increase in that time frame indicates momentum. An appropriate block size plus tracking acceleration over sub-units of the time frame may equal success. Again, we may not even need Renko as block size and position is just an arbitration of price increase above or equal to a certain threshold then add calculating acceleration over the time frame. Not the speed, but the acceleration, i.e. the rate of change of speed of the price change.
* Could “shorting” be done by having balances of certain coins and looking for conditions when they will or are falling, selling them and then buying back? Hmm… why hold them at all though, it’s not really shorting then, might as well just have the balance of the main currency and buy stuff that’s trending. It may be a way to protect holdings, i.e. watch hodl coins and when we get strong downtrends/reversals sell them and buy them back when that trend stops or goes sideways. If we are wrong on the reversal then take the loss or use a stop to buy back at or just below the original price.
* Would a dumb strategy work. Meaning forget about trends as much, sure we can look at it but maybe a simple moving average type of thing or whatever. The idea though would be to simply buy and hold. Having a range if the thing falls out of then we sell, if it rises then have a trailing stop to sell.
  * Could couple with this some sort of strategy to buy back if it reverses and starts going towards where we sold. Likewise to sell before it gets back to the price we bought.
  * This could be a portfolio management strategy, less about making profits but more about accumulating positions without losing value, avoiding large pullbacks as much as possible. All the while we’d be accumulating more and more of the coin, jumping into Tether on sells and back out on buys. With btc/eth we’d have to sell to tether immediately. However we want to protect our fiat value so doing things this way would ensure we aren’t holding coins that lose their fiat but instead continually protecting our value and increasing it little by little as we continually buy back in after down trends.
  * Again, this strategy would heavily rely on smart techniques to lessen the amount of loss or prevent it altogether when our buys/sells turn against us.
  * Perhaps the stats are such that just keeping a trailing stop (that avoids nasty wicks) would be enough since over time the market trends up? Wow, this actually makes sense.
  * In this strategy, knowing when to sell is of the utmost importance, the reverse of what I’ve been thinking so far. This also seems easier because buying the price up is harder than the price being sold down. Markets have gravity and only greed causes them to uptrend over time. Greed is Atlas.
  * We could say the main currency (tether) and then have a list of the coins we want to hodl.
  * A percentage breakdown of how many of those coins we want to hold or do we just buy them as is right then? Perhaps it just uses whatever is in your portfolio and protects them always using the same funds gained from selling to buy back even if getting less coins when we mess up? This makes sense. The user can buy whichever coins they want, the app will simply protect them or protect whichever ones are on their list. They could cordon off a certain amount of balance for that coin and the app will check and using a trailing process to buy if it’s falling or buy if it isn’t falling. Imagine that, you go in the app and say 1000 used for ethos and it automatically will find a way to buy into ethos and protect its value over time, bull markets, bear markets, protecting not just value but keeping profits afloat. Seriously, my instincts tell me that since over time the market trends up, focusing on when to sell versus when to buy is ingenious.
  * The stop could be done using the ATR. Since we’d be in the middle of the ATR then our stop would only hit if they below current price - ATR which would mean the thing is not acting normally. The buy back in stop could be set at 10% of the ATR or something so that if it starts to move back up a bit then we re-enter and again now the stop to sell would be the ATR which is larger than our 10% meaning we wouldn’t sell until it fell pretty far. Worst-case scenario we lose a bit each time following it down but at some point when we are back in ti would just keep going up. The profit if it returns to the original price would outweigh our losses since we skipped over chunks of the drop it did. Still, it would be nice to maintain as much as possible the amount of coins we have though I guess this might do that since it’s not necessarily turning back up to our 10% ATR as soon as we sell every single time it drops. Maybe a tighter stop if it drops out of our range for buying back. This is kind of flawed but I have a feeling this problem isn’t so hard to solve.
* Keeping track of longs and_or_vs shorts is a poor man’s way (though possibly quite effective) of checking market sentiment. Could be coupled with tracking the market cap to create a pretty handy sentiment score.
* Track when buy/sell walls are eaten through?
* Track liquidations? When people are liquidated the market is usually making a big move contra to the sentiments of a lot of people
* Ideas from the CAN SLIM system:
  * Find ratings for coins or rate them according to something like whether or not they do something unique. Maybe a general rating is ok. If this can be done programmatically then great. Better still to have a moving average of its reputation
  * Supply and Demand. Maybe check across several exchanges for their order books or transaction history to get a larger sense of demand across the market versus on just one exchange. Hmm, this is an interesting idea, what else could we check across exchanges? Price moves, data analysis to see if price moves on a certain exchange for a coin then it follows suit on others? (which exchanges general show btc price increasing first for instance). Volume/Activity over time - if a coin is getting busy over its normal trading range and we identify the trend them shit negro, that’s as good as anything.
* Is there a way to know what institutional investors/whales are buying? Maybe look for large orders in the order books that get filled
  * L = Leader or Laggard. A coin’s relative price strength (RSI) ranges from one to 99; a rank of 75, for example, means the company has outperformed 75% of the stocks in its market group over a particular period of time. From https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/relativestrength.asp - Calculating Relative Strength - There is more than one way to calculate an investment's relative strength. One method is to rank all investments within the same investment universe, such as tech stocks or mutual funds, and purchase the top performers. Another is to take the rate of change in a stock’s price, recorded over a specified period of time, and divide it by the rate of change in a relevant index over the same time period. The stock’s rate of change is divided by the benchmark's rate of change to get a relative strength value. If the value is greater than one, the investment is relatively strong; if the value is less than one, the investment is relatively weak.
* Index Fund / Dogs of the Dow type strategy. Pick say the top x performing coins over the last x time period and rebalance portfolio to have certain percentage stake in each. Rinse, wash and repeat.
* Ok it’s settled, we need to be able to backtest these various strategies. Just working the ideas on paper won’t do and even coding it presents a problem because I will undoubtedly get lost in the numbers. We need to be able to see this on charts and display where the strategy buys/sells and have a running tally of balances. Something that allows us to quickly modify and try strategies. TradingView is the only platform I know that offers anything like this but perhaps there are others, like a desktop solution or other sites. We need historical data as well but that’s easy enough. TradingView though has that and would allow for backtesting different time periods and different coins, perhaps easily. More research needed.
* Depending on the eventual strategy chosen, it might be simpler to just back-test with actual trades yourself, save time, make money and learn in a tactile fashion the real pros and cons of a trading idea. After all, most strategies I’m thinking about would be over medium time frames and as such should be able to be done manually with few indicators/data right?
* Is there a way to forward-test instead of back-testing, this would prove far more beneficial. Paper testing I guess but some way to do this more effectively?
* This idea of weighting everything is great but it is complex and wreaks of over-engineering. If the focus is on risk management and position sizing to the point that only small losses are ever incurred then that would free us up to having a simple system for determining entries and exits. Before deciding on any strategy, we need to research thoroughly these ideas of risk management, position sizing and exit/**re-entry** strategies.
