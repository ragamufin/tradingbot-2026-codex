* It may not make sense to always have a position. When things are sideways why not wait for momentum in order to choose a direction rather than being in a position which is 50-50.
* The ideal strategy appears to be a momentum based on. To catch the market when it is moving as early as possible and get out towards the end of the move. **NOT** to catch every move no matter how small. The profits made from getting into and out of the move nearer its edges seems like it would probably outweigh having to let some of those profits go in order to stay in the move waiting for possible continuation. Time in the market would be limited to only moving markets as opposed to always having a position.
* I’ve been getting lost in speed. What I really want to look at though is acceleration. Not the rate of change of the price which is just the speed of price change but rather, the rate of change of the speed of price change. Acceleration as one metric tells me not that the price is increasing but how fast it’s increasing and that’s a very useful thing to capture and trade off.
* I’ve also been getting lost in being in the market for the large move. However, there is another play here, being heavy with a tight stop for the smaller move.  You make the same money if you put on 3x the position and the price moves 1/3rd the distance.
  * This could result in more trades being made but not necessarily. If it can be made to find high percentage plays or to take really minimal losses and be able to go over and over again then sure go for more trades. However, if it can be limited to say breakouts or when the price moves big in a short span of time, using only that with a clear take profit then dude, that could be butter.
* Part of the problem here is I’m thinking squarely in terms of charts. While the data may be in the chart, the strategy is not. What works in terms of trading, not trading from the chart but just trading, you only need one successful idea and then work backwards from that to break down the parts of its success. That may be able to be found using chart data but there’s a chance that it may not be. For instance, checking recent trade history and tallying up buys vs sells and their volume plus looking at a rolling average of the spread between bid and ask over time are valuable indicators that cannot be found on the charts. Time is an indicator. It’s on the charts but it’s cluttered. What about time, you know it factors into profits. Most of your successful trades happen what, quickly yes? So it may be that if a trade is going and has not produced a result by a certain time, get out.

## Pros and Cons of Strategies thus far
### Step By Step
In this strategy I simply have a certain amount where the idea is that if the price moves by that amount then it is “trending”. Once the price moves this amount enter. The stop naturally is if the price reverses this amount. The idea here is that trends tend to continue and so over time entering there’ll be more consecutive blocks of the price moving in one direction than there are ranging action.
**pros**
* Simple
* adjusts the size of the block depending on price or ATR
* loss on any one trade is limited to roughly the block size
* fewer trades
* always in the market

**cons**
* fewer trades
* always in the market
* Big moves are rarer than ranging price action so you end up getting chopped up most of the time while trying to jostle into position for the big move that offsets the losses
* Waiting for confirmation means that the stops aren’t hard so price reversal may have you getting out at more than the block size
* Waiting for confirmation also means you are getting in after moves of greater than the block size, sometimes greatly so, the move may have already seen its best gains by the time you get in

**conclusions**
* Not many cons but the cons do equate with a propensity to make low profits and be only greater than even depending on the strength of the few big moves that come up.
* No prevention of multiple losses in a row since all entries have to be taken. Waiting for multiple blocks in a row could signal a trend but then it could immediately reverse. After reversal it could then even continue so counting blocks is of no help.
* Perhaps set market stop limits would limit the pullbacks.
* Perhaps paying attention to the overall trend and only taking entries in that direction instead of always being in the market

### Trailing Stop
We set a certain stop based on a fixed percentage of price, ATR. The first entry could be random as primarily our entries are based on when our stop is hit go the other way.
**pros**
* Simple
* Stop can be based on a percentage
* always in the market
* more trades, more small profit trades even in ranging markets
* inherently follows trends
* distance to stop dynamically grows depending on profit

**cons**
* Entries are picked simply based on when the stop is hit we go the other way. This is akin to randomness/gambling.
* The more profitable moves have farther stops as they gain profit. The idea here is to stay in the trend but often you get kicked out anyway giving back a fair amount of profit and now you switch to go the other way yet the move ultimately may be continuing and now your’e just stuck in ranging action before the trend resumes.
* Determining the way to trail the stop is a mixed bag, too much and you may get a larger trend but at the same time may simply end up giving back a fair amount of profits.
* No way to prevent back to back losses

**conclusions**
* Perhaps the stop could be set based on different criteria to give us more room for larger moves such as breakouts and less room for ranging action.
* Trade in the direction of the trend only
* Perhaps a take profit is needed. This would allow for catching more of a move yet possibly being able to re-enter on a retrace
* Perhaps larger trail on entry and once a certain amount is cleared, tight stop. Possibly relax this stop as price moves or mix with the idea of steps and move a step down every time price moves a step.

### Moving Average(s)
I’ve written off moving average crossovers, they’re just way too laggy to be of any use. So generally I’ve used moving averages where price breaks the moving average line. Over time I’ve come to find that less than ideal as during ranging action the price breaks the moving average line repeatedly and during trends it may break the line only to then break it again and resume the trend. So now I generally use the slope of the moving average as a tell of trend and when slope changes that is the entry/exit indicator.
**pros**
* Simple
* Catches big moves
* Keeps you in big moves well if the moving average is large or several are used and handed off to once enough profit is made

**cons**
* Get fucked in ranging price action. Hard.
* Too tight and you don’t make much profit, just chopped and screwed, too large and you catch moves where you go into large profit only to give them up, sometimes ending up at a loss.
* Switching from tight MA to large MA when it profit is problematic as again, a large chunk of profit is eventually given up, sometimes long before the whole trend is over.
* In the market a long time with just one trade and profits to show for it, profits that could be evaporated by a large impulsive move counter to the trend at any time.
* Shite at catching trend reversals, it’ll catch the trend once it gets going and keep you in the trend but the reversal itself when switching from one direction to another, it has no handle on.

**conclusions**
* MA’s are no good at timing entries or exits as they are just too laggy. That lag however works well in giving a sense of overall market conditions. They can tell when you are in the throes of a trend and using one or more of them can tell you both the larger, overall trend as well as the short-term trend and if you are in a bounce though we don’t know if it may be temporary or lead to reversal. They do not tell you if you are in a reversal but neither can any indicator really.
* They are late to indicate range entry/exit and trading them in a range results almost unconditionally in losses.
* If several MA’s are employed they do appear to tell where support/resistance levels are albeit in a rough manner. After all, by their very nature they do exactly that, wrap average price action.
* MA’s I conclude, cannot be the primary indicator to base a strategy upon. Not just as they are anyway, perhaps step MA’s can mitigate some of their problems, a step TRIX for example.

### Multiple MA’s
Several of my earlier strategies involved using several MA’s of varying lengths to give an idea of the trend for different time frames. As price crossed one you could enter and would add to position as it crossed the others as it meant that the trend was changing more and more to the other side. Displaced MA’s were also tried in order to have natural places to not only add to position but to use as stops.
**pros**
* Catches the large trends
* Stays very well in the larger trend avoiding bounces and ranges

**cons**
* Complex
* Catches the large trends late
* Gives up profits on reversal due to all the room it gives you by the time you are at the end of a very large trend.
* No good in ranges
* Makes profit on smaller trends but the problem of giving back a fair amount of profit in order try to stay in the larger trend is complex and possibly unsolvable as you never know if this medium trend will become a large one or not or if this bounce is the start of a reversal.

**conclusions**
* If catching and staying in the large trend is the goal then this is a decent system for it. It does exactly that at the cost of giving back some profits on reversals or large bounces.
* On medium sized moves it will be limited on how much profit you get since  it allows for a lot of retracing to occur.
* Using MA’s manually coded to only take into calculation price when price has moved a certain amount, helps to avoid getting caught in chop but sooner or later the MA’s will get you chopped and screwed and can do so for quite some time.

### Step by Step with MA/Trailing stop
Here we combine the step by step strategy with a dynamic trailing stop. Instead of simply setting the stop at the bounds of the step, we employ a trailing stop that dynamically grows as profit increases or an MA to keep us in the trend for as long as possible avoid chop.
**pros**
* Different trading style for different types of price action. Step traversal for timing entries on the basis that if price moves a step it is starting a trend. Then the MA/trailing stop to keep you in that trend.
* Fewer trades
* Catches the big move

**cons**
* Schizophrenic, when price enters a range the steps are of no use if they are smaller than the range.
* Trailing stop just doesn’t seem good enough for staying in trends
* MA’s are good for staying in trends but at a cost that you often overstay beyond reversal.

**conclusions**
* Manually adjusting an MA to only take into calculation price when price has moved a step has some promise. This diminishes the drawback of MA’s getting closer and closer to the price when it is ranging but not going anywhere as the MA will not move except when steps are changed. Still, if we have a range larger than our step, then we will still end up in the problem of the MA ending up flat and intersecting with price action.

### Enter Range once trend stops
This is strategy that I tried with most of the others since ranges/consolidations tended to be a weak point of all the other strategies. The idea here is that once we switch from long to short or vice versa and we are realizing no gains, little gains or a loss then we assume to be in a range and employ a different style of trading. For instance no trading at all in the range and waiting for breakout.
**pros**
* Tries to trade differently depending on whether we are trending or ranging
* Did well at indicating when we are entering a range
* Did better than any other strategies so far at avoiding being chopped up in ranges
* Did more or less well at catching breakouts

**cons**
* Complex
* Trading ranges is hard. Their edges are fuzzy. Furthermore, some ranges slowly expand as price appears to break out a bit and then consolidates again, often returning back into the original range.
* Determining the bounds of the range is an ongoing problem.
* When breakouts occur this thing looks ok in back-tests but it is clear that in reality, even with automated trading, if you only enter when there is a range breakout then often you are playing catch up to try to get in, only to have it reverse on you.

**conclusions**
* Could benefit from taking into account the overall trend
* No exact way to demarcate ranges
* Ultimately not profitable as it is focused on catching the large move. It does that on paper but I fear it would not in real life as it is only making entries on breakouts, which could be false breakouts or happen so fast that you get a less than ideal entry versus having already been in the market before the breakout happens.

### Range Trading
Identify ranges and buy/sell the bounds of the range when price action crosses those bounds. If exiting the range it is considered a breakout and we enter or switch position accordingly. If crawling back into a range we enter there going in the same direction with the idea being to buy support and sell resistance.
**pros**
* When to enter/exit is straightforward
* Natural add to position areas.
* If we sell resistance and price goes on to break support you’re already in since the top of the range
* Sells/buys repeatedly should price whipsaw over the range’s boundary so that once the price moves away you’ll be on the right side

**cons**
* Difficult to demarcate ranges, this is difficult in trading view but also in life as well.
* Price sometimes crosses back and forth across the range’s “boundary” resulting in repeated entries/exits at small loss
* Candles crawling back into a range or out on a “breakout” don’t stop cleanly at the range’s edge so you can end up with an entry very far from the range itself. Often the price retraces to the edge which puts you at a loss (unless it then reverses and continues) and you could have had a better entry.
* No handling of trending price, which is fine. However, the algorithm for finding ranges is wholly inept as you don’t know where the range is till you reject off of it. Price action may or may not return there. In addition, a range boundary will be crossed and then prices comes back in resulting in that range boundary being extended to the new bounds of the range but you may be in a position that was not taken anywhere near that new boundary.
* No take profit action except for if you enter at one side of the range and exit the other. Even a bounce there was not caught, price had to cross it then come back in before the position was closed. So often, the price would bounce off a side of the range, we enter, the price crawls up to the middle of the range then turns and goes right back through the range boundary, we had profit but then had to close at a loss when the range was exited, possibly at a large loss since that candle stick could have broken the range and gone a fair distance. This happens often enough to be a major drawback of this strategy.
* Once a range is exited and we bounce somewhere, that becomes the new “other side”. The old other side is not kept and so if we ever ended back there we would not know it until there is a bounce. This may be ok since support and resistance levels aren’t fixed and each time we go there they may be a little different so discovering them anew may be worth it.

**conclusions**
* Need a way to treat the bounds as an area rather than a single, exact line
* It may be prudent to not wait for confirmation but to place buy and sell orders at support and resistance and maybe even hard stops. If this is possible to test in trading view then it might worth giving it a shot. Or simply to look at some charts and see if it would work
* It might be worth keeping 3 lines in trading view so that we keep track of the previous range as well.
* Once there is a breakout, price may travel quite far before making the new “other side” of the range. So the side we just broke out from switches to be support or resistance but it becomes quite a job to map resistance support levels as price action goes about its merry way.

### Indicators
All manner of indicators were employed in different ways. Stochastic, RSI, Super Trend, etc.
**pros**
* Come up with a set of rules for when to enter/exit depending on the indicator or cocktail of indicators and follow it
* These indicators and/or strategies have within them some complexity and while being shielded from that you can still benefit from employing them into your own strategy.

**cons**
* Oscillating indicators were very prone to tell you enter/exit while price action was doing the opposite.
* Was not able to find any indicator that gave any consistent edge
* Any one indicator or trading view strategy seemed incomplete on its own and trying to mix and match things together proved to be a fruitless hassle.

**conclusions**
* Price action should be the first and primary “indicator”
* Relying on indicators too much can take you into a bubble of sorts where you are trying to come up with an array of rules to trade by based on the values the indicators give you. This is divorced from reality where trading is just people trying to buy at one price and then sell at another. Indicators on their own are just not “intelligent”, they are just dissections of market data hobbled together to tell you what has already happened but in a way to try to predict what may happen. I find this to be a seductively addictive self delusion. This is not the indicators’ fault, well not usually, but it is a slippery slope. In the end, any strategy that will work will probably be a “natural” strategy, one rooted in common sense **reactive** rules that don’t aim too much to interpret market behaviour.  Ultimately probably more a framework that makes bets based on probable outcomes looking at the price action up to the current moment and then setting entry/exit points to take advantage of the those probable outcomes while losing little should they not come to pass. Reactive and Adaptive, that may be the ticket. Indicators can play a role in that but only secondarily.

### Hedging
The idea here is to have both a long and a short, one of the perps that pays you for going counter to the market and one of on the futures going in the way of the market. Ideally if you are in profit on an entry and price reverses then you go the other way as well, locking in the profit. This gives you time to decide if this is a reversal or a pause before continuation. Once that determination is made, you close of sell some of the other position and let the one going with the market ride. It is a poor man’s option trading.
**pros**
* Only need to ever find one successful entry
* Never need to fully exit
* No need for stops
* Can be used to lock in a fixed loss until you are clear about the market direction and if you guess right you can turn the loss into a profit.
* Can repeatedly make profits on open positions and ranges by continually buying/selling the same prices as the price ranges.

**cons**
* This does not lessen the difficulty of the task of determining if this is a temporary bounce or reversal. The moment you close one side you are now in a quandary as to whether or not you will be giving profits away if the market turns against your existing entry.
* One side will often be at a loss.
* Requires constant checking and so is not suited for manual trading. Nor can we do this on trading view so the only way to test is by coding it. The logic must be soundly worked out ahead of time if it is to have a chance.
* Needs math to figure out how much to sell/add
* With little effort a profitable position can become an immensely unprofitable one.  I’ve suffered large losses on this and even been rekt.
* Futures and Perps are not one to one in their price movements, you could be incurring a larger loss on one compared to the other.
* Even with automated trading there is some lag between deciding to close/limit a side of the hedge and actually making the orders.

**conclusions**
* This is a strategy that has some promise and may need more research. The pro of not needing stops is a big one.
* No good on BitMex that does not calculate your liquidation price together across all your open positions. Better to use on Deribit.
* Where to place you stop once you close a side is super important.
* Ideally the price starts to approach one side of the hedge, you let it go, after the momentum slows down you re-enter that side, locking in the profit, possibly increasing that profit by selling the bounce and letting the original direction ride.
* Consider an MA for the overall trend and that will be the side on the futures. The perps would be used only for the hedged side and it is only let go or re-entered or some of it is closed at the start of impulsive moves or the end but never during. This is a how I got rekt, attempting to manage the sides of the hedge during an impulsive move.
* Consider using the perps for impulse trades and the futures for long trends. Losses on one would be offset by the other. The short-term impulsive perps trades could be limited to trades counter to the long trend one you’re holding on the futures so that losses would definitely be offset by the long-term one.
* If we are to treat them separately then it may simply be a matter of having a long-term and short-term strategy and running them separately but picking the perps for one and the futures for one, indistinct of each other.

## Overall conclusions
* Paying attention to the overall trend, the trend will save you
* Not always being in the market.
  * May be ok for longs on btc but for other coins it may be less than ideal if they are increasing in price and you’re sitting out in tether. That being said, if they are trending then you’d probably be in and the times when you are not, you’re preserving capital.
  * It is clear that picking entries simply based on when one trade goes sour, go the other way is a losing strategy. So a way to determine clearly, when to enter, switch or exit entirely needs to be designed. As long as you’re making decent profit over time who cares if you miss out on some profit. By choosing entries decidedly versus just when we exit one we go the other way, we stand a better chance of avoiding losses , improving our entry to profit and risk to profit odds.
  * It is also interesting to note that my winning trades have usually happened quickly. If you are in a trade and price is just ranging and you’re “hoping” for a breakout. Perhaps once a certain amount of time has elapsed that trade should be abandoned or have its stop moved aggressively close. So a timed trailing stop. These trades where a long time is spent in the market are less predictable and inevitably a move comes along and kicks you out at a loss, break-even or with a smaller profit. Even after that the move may even resume in your direction. Better to take the profit and then catch the move once it resumes than sit there waiting for a 50-50 that it will go your way.
  * You don’t need to and **shouldn’t** try to catch every move. It is a recipe for a low profit system.
* Adding to position hasn’t been given its just due. A strategy that has clear places to add to existing positions helps to increase profits on winning positions without jeopardizing existing profits. It allows for making smaller entries and thus smaller losses on losing trades while being able to milk larger moves for larger profits with clear exit points if the moves goes back on you. Getting into a profitable position is a big deal and playing that right when it happens is a big deal. Limiting losses to as small as possible is a big deal and so adding to position becomes very valuable in this scenario.
* There is a balance between catching big moves and catching smaller moves. If you can consistently make profits on smaller moves, say in ranges, then it is superior to a strategy wholly dependent on catching the big move. After all most of the time the market is making small moves. Any strategy that catches the smaller moves will undoubtedly catch several parts of the larger move.
* It is necessary to think about price action as being in different phases. I can see that there are:
  * Pump (impulsive and quick move up with large volume and force. This also covers “breakouts”)
  * Dump (like a pump but going the other way. Dumps tend to be quicker and more ferocious as gravity is a bitch)
  * Floating (price choppily and slowly moves up/down over time)
  * Consolidation (After pump or dump, price action starts to range, usually sloping up/down before another pump or dump)
  * Bullish (pump, consolidate, pump, consolidate, over an extended period of time)
  * Bearish (dump, consolidate, dump, consolidate, over an extended period of time)
  * Rejection (a pump or dump followed, often immediately, by a strong move the other way. This covers false breakouts as well though it should be noted that a breakout can sometimes “float” back into the range it came from)
  * Stair-casing (Price action moving in a given direction over a medium time frame by gentle pump or dumps followed by not so long consolidation/floating action. Price moves in that direction onwards almost against the will of all indicators, slow enough to not really be seen to be going anywhere but yet making noticeable gains over time)
* How are these phases different and is it necessary to have parts of the strategy to identify the various types and trade accordingly or is there a one size fits all strategy that evens out to be decently profitable regardless of the type of price action we are facing. My experience thus far hints at having at least 2 types of trading in place for the different types of price action and being able to identify which type we are in so that we can trade accordingly. I can see basically 3 main types:
  * Impulsive (pump, dump, breakouts, some rejections)
  * Ranging (consolidation)
  * Trending (bullish_bearish_floating/stair-casing)
* Oddly enough, the ones that seem to be most profitable are Impulsive and ranging. Trending tends to have a bit of both those two in them and getting in at the start of a trend isn’t easy and you can quite easily end up seeing any gains washed away by an impulsive move. Trends take time and don’t go in a straight line up or down so adding to position is difficult and trailing a stop to still stay in such trends where you are in the market for days, weeks, is quite inefficient. So far I’ve been focused on catching the “trend”, hoping to get in one day and still be in a month later watching the profit pile up. This is ok probably for options trading or an account that just does these trades in order to preserve capital and over the long term add to position after price has moved say 20% in a direction in total but for making serious gains, it is less than ideal. Serious gains come not from the A+ plays that are few and far between but from the B’s that are plentiful though having smaller gains individually. In fact, trading a dump by catching parts of it that are impulsive could prove to be more profitable than staying in the trend because the impulsive barging up or crashing down is where most of the money for a tend following strategy is made. A good short-term strategy would still be able to catch a large part of that impulsive move, probably even more of it since it does not give much profit back in order to stay in the trade.
* So a big conclusion here is the need to be more momentum based, at least to thoroughly give it a go. Even consider take profit targets. From everything here the one dark horse that rears its head is that this idea of momentum has a higher probability of playing out, lessens time in trades and moves a fairly large distance.
  * You make the same money if you put on 3x the position and the price moves 1/3rd the distance. Consider heavier trades or different amounts depending on the type of trade or the size of the momentum in order capitalize on higher probability moves.
* If we are focused on momentum, then any range trading would be geared towards breakouts and getting in on one side and letting the other side run, closing in profit if it goes back up into the trend.
* Consider doing the dynamic trailing stop that **tightens** with profit rather than expand. I’ve seen stuff saying this is more profitable than a fixed or expanding stop and it sort of makes sense, especially for a short-term trading strategy trying to make as many trades as possible.
* If there is a desire to stay in large trends then a moving average does in fact work if it is not used for entries but after a trade is in decent profit, the moving average is used to determine the exit. As such it will avoid weaker bounces and keep you in an overall trend which is something that it is difficult for more responsive indicators. By their lagging nature they can also tell you roughly where support/resistance ranges are.
* Any attempt to demarcate ranges/support and resistance will be difficult. They are not lines in the sand but an area and it is not uncommon for the price action to cross those areas and then be rejected or to start ranging there and then reverse.
* Let’s really think about, research and work out the math on a hedging strategy. Theoretically the Octavia Strategy works.
* Perhaps what we will end up needing is several strategies hobbled together. For instance a support and resistance, impulsive and hedging strategy together. The support and resistance part does entries and exits, the hedging part is used instead of stops and to buy time for new support/resistance to be established. The impulsive part tells us to let go of a side of the hedge once the market starts to move impulsively and to re-buy the hedge once the market stops the impulse and starts to range. A failsafe is needed so that should an impulse fizzle out we close all positions and take the current loss or profit. A dynamic trailing stop (fixed, widening or tightening) could be used instead of tracking the momentum slowing down in order to exit impulsive moves since these moves will slow down and yet see price continue in their direction. Or, a weighted combination of the momentum and the price continuing or reversing.

### What Next?
* Need to get a handle on momentum. How to accurately catch its start, end and acceleration.
  * The slope of an MA does seem to have some benefit in determining momentum:


* Hard stops and limit orders, does trading view handle these correctly? How does it display them? Are wicks going to be a show stopper for this? If wick-ed out, then what?
* What is the balance between small profits, many trades and staying in the market for longer and larger profits
* Need to figure out a cogent hedging strategy, including for losing positions and whether or not it is viable for automated trading.
* May need to have a decent algorithm for identifying and tracking support and resistance. If not on trading view then look at btc’s chart to see how well support and resistance are respected over time and whether or not it is worthwhile to track them continually or to simply track the current range.
* Do breakouts of ranges or support and resistance come with any patterns, such as high volume or an impulsive move?
* Do MA’s work well as support and resistance, even if we have to refer to different time frames?
* Should I only take trades within the overall trend?

### Summary
* Success depends entirely on making money on ranges, focus there!
* Next, add to position is a must. It’s the secret sauce for building up a heavy trade and having wider stops to get you into profit especially when trading with the trend.
* When to get out is the next most important thing. You shouldn’t be having back to back large drawdowns, small ones are totally ok, as many as necessary **if** they almost guarantee you a big payoff most of the time.
* Set stops market stops versus waiting for confirmation
* Stop hunts are real. Your strategy should not be prone to them but rather take advantage of them.
* Don’t stay in the market, switching from long to short, pick your battles, high risk-reward plays that are bountiful and easy to play.
* MA’s are great for:
  * telling the trend, especially your step MA’s
  * They could also even identify ranges (for instance if the step MA’s haven’t moved for a large period of time)
  * Where to place your stops
  * Possibly good places for adding to positions.
  * Are natural support and resistance identifiers as they are “moving averages” after all.
* Support and Resistance are great for:
  * Knowing where to place your stops
  * Breakouts and fake breakouts
  * Where to add to positions
  * Also think about trend lines, possibly using that line thing you found on the web going through scattered points to go through the highs and lows of a range
* Momentum is good for:
  * Entries
  * Quick low risk, high reward setups with tight stops
  * Identifying breakouts and picking sides in ranges
* Try putting the various pieces on a chart and see what you see. MA’s, SR and momentum. Getting each one fine tuned and then seeing how they interplay should give some insight as these are the what you’ve found to be the most intuitive thus far, save for momentum which we have yet to get a good handle on.
* Seriously, work out and come to a conclusion on hedging, especially for ranges If you can get this right then almost all the issues here disappear, you have a strategy virtually guaranteed to either break-even, make a small loss and almost never miss big moves. Not to mention collect funding.
* Look into options trading, along the lines of the previous point about hedging, this may be a smarter way to be in the market as you don’t have to get the timing right, just the direction and your risk.
* In ranges, having spent a long time in a position, consider dropping part of the position in order accumulate at a better price, moving your average price farther and farther away from price action as you can
* Any strategy might benefit from keeping an eye on the overall trend and either avoid trades counter to it using smaller positions when making trades counter to the trend. In crypto’s parabolic rise the market mostly went up, trading in that direction would have not so great trades still be saved. Since then we’ve been on a downward trajectory despite bounces here and there. Why not take advantage of that, trends tend to continue, that’s why they are trends after all
