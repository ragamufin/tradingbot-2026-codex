crypto project that creates contracts that allow for making customizable conditions for a pool of funds. Simulates things such as:

* Multi-sig wallet
* Multi-sig wallet where each user has to “check in” periodically or have their permission revoked
* vesting schedules for tokens so that they automatically get released over time or under certain conditions
* Multi-sig wallet where say people have different weights or where person x cannot empty the wallet but requires at least 8 out of the other 10 to agree yet even if 9 out of 10 agree but person x does not then the funds cannot be touched
* Conditions can be applied even to a single person, so you can lock up funds and have them vested out to you or only released (including just partially) under certain market conditions such as say btc falls at least 50%
