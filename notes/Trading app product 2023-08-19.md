* This hits me in the feels
* I've been developing trading strategies and doing all sorts of stuff these past few years
* I keep coming back to the fact that I need to be able to quickly prototype and test ideas
* I also had the idea to make a visual trading app for users
* I, myself, need to be able to quickly put together and test trading strategies that ->
  * Work across multiple
    * time frames
    * assets
    * multi-collateral
    * chart types
  * Allow for partial exits
  * Give stats
  * Quickly iterate and test permutations of the idea
  * Easy alerts. Across devices, assets, based on complex conditions
* Given the above and the fact that I need to and am building some version of this anyway... Sell the product you yourself need
* It also kills another bird with the same stone. That of building a badass development stack that is multi-platform and sexy af

**Why not sell shovels to the gold diggers**
Meaning, build it and then push it as a product. Others would be able to quickly ->
* Whip together strategies
* Maybe have a visual mode to drag and drop bricks
* And a coding interface for writing code
* Visual output on tv chart
* Test and see comprehensive data
* Step through history
* Forward test
* Test on random data
* Be able to do all the things I know I need as listed above such as multi-asset, time-frames, etc.
* Imagine being able to very quickly cobble together a strategy to trade btc and eth against each other and usd with multiple entries, partial exits, across various time frames, chart types and see comprehensive stats on the outcome
  * emphasis on quickly
  * emphasis on cobble, i.e. it should be easy to build

### The problem
* Trading view, meta trader and their EAs. They are super complex to build. You need to be a coder and they fall short in allowing you to do most of those things necessary beyond the most beginner strategies
* Meta trader is kind of ugly. Trading view is sexy but slow and heavy

### But wait, there's more
* Gallery of strategies with their numbers and stats so people can get ideas
* Strategies can go live. This could be a paid feature (amongst others). People could run the app locally (with GUI or headless) but they could pay for hosting the strategy. Connectors are available so that they can input their api keys, two-factor authorization, whitelist accessing ips, make groups of users with varying rights, etc.
* Community
  * Copy trading
  * Copy coding. This would be soliciting coders to build your strategy for you, some sort of auction maybe
  * Discord, Telegram, Twitter
  * Feed of what's happening with various strategies across the platform, especially when volatility spikes
  * Comment on pages of the app, like commenting on strategies, accounts, feed, etc.

* Can trade against DEXes and CEXes
* Trade mode that can
  * Do complex triggers like by eth when btc hits a certain price
    * At this UTC time put in an order at market, limit at top of the book, x% below, trigger order at %x below or above, etc.
  * IFTTT
  * Chain trades together
  * Chain trades together across various chains, accounts etc.
  * Make a trade on the spot from any of your connected accounts. This alone is a killer feature. Instead of having to sign into each CEX/DEX, from one place you can see your stuff and execute a trade
  * TWAP
  * Think about all the things you used to do with ichibot, those things
* Sleek overview of all your accounts and strategies to be able to track performance over time

* Its own defi. Users can stake to various strategies that are running against defi
* They can get meta and create strategies that run against other strategies
* They can stake to some general AI strategy of the platform that in turn longs, shorts and counter-trades the best and worst performing strategies

* The stats of the platform would be invaluable to financial firms, quants, media outfits, etc.
* Partnerships could be made in the space, we offer liquidity, they offer lower/no trading fees
* Coagulates liquidity through bridging, partnerships with bridges, having its own wallets on various chains so that a central ledger can credit and debit users without having to actually move assets

* Bank account / Wallet
  * Put in crypto
  * Transfer with the app to other users with a sleek interface and simple process
  * Pay with the app in person or online (API for accepting/making payments)
  * Savings account
    * Maybe automatically stakes in the best yield farms

* Dude, the sky is the limit on this! 
* I'm seriously getting the feels just like that Sunday AD showed up to futsal saying he just 4x-ed his money in crypto. I just had the idea so maybe it's excitement from the newness of it. And frankly I've had this idea all along. However, I gotta say right now, it feels like THIS IS IT
* The fact that I get to build a tech stack for mobile, desktop, web and have to learn smart contracts, that seals it, it combines a bunch of my biggest desires together!
* Another point, this cobbles together so much of what people in crypto do plus wraps it up to allow them to have one stop in order to use and manage their crypto. It actually could be a top use-case for crypto. It really doesn't add anything new but just by having it all in one place, that is new, that is the big deal. As users increase, it has the emergent property that if everyone is on it then things like transfers, payments, become a big deal

### How it makes $
* Hosting and running strategies
* Taking a fee for performing (complex?) trades
* Coincidence of Wants (COW)
* Vendors accepting payments
