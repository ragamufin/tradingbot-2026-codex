* Choose to start with either a buy or a sell
* Choose a start price or %
* Choose an offset amount or %
* choose % profit to cycle between

This will start doing a trailing limit from the start price buying/selling. Once the order is filled it will follow the market until your target % profit is made then start trailing limit in reverse of the one set before aiming for the same percent profit. Rinse and repeat. Especially good in sideways markets.

* Possibly have some strategies for if the cycle is broken for instance you sell but then the price reverses and goes up. Maybe if below the fee then buy back in.
* Notifications, especially when kicked out of a cycle.
* Cloud.
