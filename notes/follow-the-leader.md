The idea here is simple, follow the actions of known big funds that are investing that have a good track record and mimic them

For instance Ark Invest
* Investigage their track record, if good then continue
* Watch their actions, for instance 2026-02-12 read the news: 
  * [Ark Invest buys Bullish stock for 9th straight day in $11.6 million purchase](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/12/ark-buys-usd11-6-million-of-bullish-shares-in-ninth-consecutive-day-of-buying-blsh)
  * [ARK Invest adds $34M Robinhood stake as Bitcoin falls below $66K](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ark-buy-robinhood-34-million-bitcoin-slip-below-66k)
    
* Usually the funds don't get the best prices. So buy lower when they buy, sell higher when they sell

The other day is doing this by following actions onchain
Dexes like Hyperliquid and Lighter have their transactions onchain as well as community pools etc.
* You would track, historically and going forward, their record and watch the addresses that are good performers
* You make trades when these winners trade
* You could do correlations between the accounts and try to diversify which accounts you trade with by selected a mix of ones that are least correlated to each other yet whose track records when combined give you a great payoff with little drawdown
* You could also allocate a smaller portion of the funds towards the losers, i.e. do the reverse of what you do with the winners, watch accounts (as uncorrelated as possible) that consistently lose and long what they short, short what they long
* Manage risk in a smart way across the portfolio
