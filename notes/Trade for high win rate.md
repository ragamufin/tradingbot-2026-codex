# Trade for high win rate, small wins and avoiding giving it all back

Fascinating take on the markets from the above video with 
The thesis being (at minute 36 of the video)
> If I were to ask you where you live right now "what's the weather next week?" Your success almost negative, almost dismal, you're going to lose almost every time I ask you the question. If I ask you the same question but I say "What's the weather next hour?" Your success goes up

> Because I limit myself to what I look for and how far into the future I look for it, I know when I'm wrong and I can stop and then right myself or get onto the other side or do whatever I need to do

at minute 48
> Everybody's trying to catch the breakout and what precedes the breakout? False breaks. What's a false break? A bounce. If you learn to play bounces and you fix breakouts, you repair breakouts, you average your way out of a breakout
> The breakouts are fewer percentage-wise than the bounces. So if I'm here for probability trades, the probability is on the bounce not on the break
> If you think of a market top, you can have a V top, few days later a double top, then a triple top. That's bounce, bounce, bounce. Do you hear quadruple tops, quintuple tops, that's usually when you see the breakout. So 1, 2, 3 bounces, sure, I'll play a bounce. On the fourth, I don't play a bounce, I expect a break 

> There is no such thing as trends. It's just sideways markets, on top of sideways markets

at minute 51
> It's like an insurance company. They keep collecting premiums and premiums and then every now and then there is a claim and they "push back"

Jean-Francois Boucher

* He just tries to get a premium from the market
* put the stats on your side and trade them
* Instead of trying to get as much of what the market has to offer, essentially swing trading, instead -> 
  * limit yourself to scalping those few pips that the market offers over and over again every single day and let those pile up
  * Guard against giving it all back. The common result of chop, chop, big win, big loss. Change that to a zillion small wins, smaller and fewer losses done in such a way that it's damn near impossible for you to be caught in a big move against you that eats away from your account significantly
* He also adds positions over time to manage where break-even is in order to "manage" his trades. This is similar to my idea of just using stats and sprinkling smaller orders over the market a high probability times with an eye on your pnl to be more and more on the right side of the market. Rather than going for gold though, you can go simply for another "win", forget wherever the market goes after the win. You can compensate for "missing out" in so many other ways such as:
  * by keeping a stack of $ and asset and putting profits into both pots
  * running multiple strategies, a trend following one, a mean reversion one and then this one would be just a premium gathering one that complements the others
  * Several accounts or separately managed trades with their own take profits so that one could be at a loss when another is opened and it wins and closes even while the other is still at a loss
* At minute 44 he says all he's doing is trading support on resistance on short time frames in order to catch the bounce, **NOT** the swing, the **bounce**. That bounce fills my pocket with change over and over again then I walk out the casino. If I over stay my welcome, the casino   wins every day
  * I guess his strategy is a mean reversion one to some extent. He may take cues from the larger time frames to establish a trend and then play bounces on the smaller time frame when price retraces to support levels  of the smaller and/or larger time frame
  * Also important to note that once his time is up, he's out, win or loss. Furthermore, it seems that if he hits some daily target premium, he's also leaves the casino. Interesting
* At minute 47 he talks about adding to positions and how there's some limit to that. If the trades just won't work then he actively starts closing losers. Interesting
  * I'm always reluctant to make my strategies around closing losers but based on everything around this guy's style it seems that it is worthwhile to investigate strategies that are stop based (time and/or fixed)
* Just like his idea of the insurance company collecting small premiums from many folks all the time and then servicing large claims from a few people every now and then while pushing back against those claims. This mirrors my trend following strategies. They have lower win ratios but suffer smaller losses often and then every now and then get a massive win that surpasses the cumulative losses. So what if I could trade that but at the same time have a similar strategy that is also profitable but works over the converse. Meaning it makes small gains all the time from chop, high win rate but every now and then suffers a loss due to a breakout. Having stops or some means to mitigate that so that the EV on the strategy is positive overall. Like this, both strategies would work together to have more muted gains but ideally much more muted losses, maybe actually even gains during the chop such that overall the gains are greater than each strategy on its own
* In keeping with flipping things on its head, he actually uses wide stops while going for small wins. He "manages" his position, adding, subtracting while keeping risk to the stop I guess within his target amount to lose on any one "managed" session

His ideas harken me back to a simple realization I've mulled over so many times. The market moves back and forth a small amount all day every day for the most part. Big moves are few and far between, many of even those get undone subsequently anyway. So isn't it possible to just pick up $1 per trade on an asset over and over again, taking many many trades throughout any given period? 

Let's definitely try to think this through again, now that I have some more experience under my belt. I think I get bogged down in trying to 1) Get bigger moves/swings and 2) Avoid being caught up on the wrong side of a big move in a big way. Those are 2 sides of the same coin and have nothing to do with the overall thesis because there are a great many ways to just go for $1 profit, without putting your arse on the line in a big way. Just gotta go first principles and come at it fresh without getting stuck on the details nor pushed back to those other 2 points

### Possibilities
#### Counter-trade for premium
* Stay in asset/cash with one stack, counter trade your position with the other stack. 
* So you'd look for longs when in cash, shorts when in the asset
* Go for premium, not swings or momentum, just grab pips from the market
#### Statistic based
* Capture stats across the market in terms of moves, distance of moves, volatility, time it takes for moves, etc. 
* Using these stats then a weighting arises for likely direction of current price action and time for it to take to get there
* Find some way to have triggers or just every x period of time close / open trades to keep in line with the stats. The goal is that your wins, losses, RR, pnl, etc. should be closely aligned with the stats when they are run over recent history
