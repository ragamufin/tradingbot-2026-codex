The plan is to use the cheaper prices we can get with tether that also result in higher rises in value when btc / eth rise in order to not only make money but save losses.
These purchases need to happen as near bottom (in tether price) as possible

New profits
- [ ] BNB
- [ ] Neo
- [ ] Ethereum
- [ ] bch
- [ ] ltc (if dirt cheap)

Save these alts by buying them at rock bottom tether price and/or cycling them whenever they rise and fall in tether price

- [ ] Nano
- [x] KCS
- [ ] BlockV

These we will try to get/maintain as much of their original value in btc / eth as we can. If at profit then we can use the btc / eth with tether. If the tether price rises and falls widely then consider moving them to tether and cycling
- [x] ChainLink
- [ ] OMG

If we can spare it get some of the following at cheap tether prices. If not then we will use our salvation from above to later get into them on dips and make profits that way
