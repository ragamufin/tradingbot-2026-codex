This is the part I didn’t understand from your strategy.

You buy and sell BTC for a 1$ profit and cover you ass with shorts in case the market tanks. 

Let’s say you have 1BTC to trade with, you made 5000$ that you’re keeping in USDT and then the market tanks.
How effectively do the shorts cover you ass and how badly do you get REKT if the market dows the opposite. Moons when you’ve got a bunch of shorts. 
That’s the part I just cannot imagine.

Me:

exactly the kinds of questions I want
I wrote the question for AI as it understands things like shorting
For you and Ali, both of you seemed to get tripped up on the shorting part

It's not shorting to cover myself. It's the same as if I bought, you can ignore the fact that it's a short, shorting is just buying in reverse, just confusing until you do it once and then the light bulb goes off. Nothing to it

The reason for shorting is just to make money from the funding rate but in every way it's the same as if I bought at 1 price and sold $1 higher

so ignore the shorting part, just think, buy and sell higher to make $1

but if you did read the thing and you're ok to ask me more stupid questions, maybe you can make time to meet me say before futsal or something some time and talk about it
Ali will be at QB on Tuesday and will ask me his stupid questions then

AD: 
So if you have a bunch of shorts and the market pumps, no harm done? 
Your shorts don’t hit and you don’t purchase BTC low? That’s the only thing?

And when the shorts hit; you use USDT to get a bigger position?! Your shorts hit and your USDT is redeployed into more BTC?

Me:
for every short there is the equal amount of btc already held... so it's flat
it's taking profit

got 1 btc on spot at 100k,
put a short on the perps for 1 btc at 100k + $1
net exposure is 0, you have $1 profit
close short at 100k, no more short but you still have 1 btc spot + $1 profit made from the closed short

you keep 3 pots though, let's say 30% in btc, 30% in usdt and then 40% is the pot for making the $1 a million times
that 40% you don't put it all in, you take maybe 1% of it on every buy, so 0.4% of your account goes into 1 order. You sell it higher. You can have up to 10 orders, totally 10% of that 40% bucket. Confusing, so best to talk in person

With each order closed, let's say you make $1 profit. 30 cents goes into the usdt bucket for keeps. 30 cents worth of the btc you don't sell but keep, goes into the btc bucket. The 40 cents of remaining profit stays in the 40% trading bucket so it can make a little bigger trade on the next trades

rinse and repeat

the btc side pot is take advantage of if the market goes up and up
the usdt side pocket makes it so if the market goes down and down and you're taking on more buys that don't get closed, well, you're not as much down as the market is
If both side pots do their job then over time it's a wash or you're slightly up on the btc side, they help to mitigate the inventory you get stuck with from the 40% pot

the goal though is that 40% pot making lots and lots of trades a day, when the market is ranging... picking up pennies over and over

AD:
I still don’t understand how you can make profit from the 1 BTC strategy. I mean you can make profit in BTC which is cool if you’ve got 4 years to wait for the next bullrun.
I think instead of starting with 1 BTC, selling for 1$ profit to USDT you should either start with 0.5 BTC and 0.5BTC worth of USDT or 1 BTC and 1BTC worth of USDT.
And trade the big BTC dumps.

Makes more sense to me. 
You know what they say: BTC is the king.
You know what they say:
USDT is the king.

So whatever you do, you can’t lose that 1 BTC?
Worst case scenario the market dumps and you lose value but still have 1BTC?

Me:
not quite
again, best explained in person
this strategy is not concerned with how much btc is held, it's focus is on USDT. I know, confusing
We don't want btc, we want btc to go up and down over and over

we take orders, multiple over time to a certain limit, and each one that goes up a bit is sold. Again this is for the middle 40% pot right? If it's working right, it has say 3 btc orders at most at different prices and each one sells for $1 higher. It wants to be flat

so the worst case scenario is this ->

The market tanks and tanks and let's say I don't code into this strategy anything that stops buying more btc, then at some point I'll be out of cash to buy in that 40% bucket and I'll have just btc, wating to sell at higher prices (+$1 profit for each buy) but we are down and it can't sell

In this scenario I wouldn't have 1 btc, I'd have more than 1 because I would have bought a little each leg down the market takes

make sense?

AD:
Yeah. With a pen and a piece of paper

Me:
ust forget the shorts.... just think about the buy and sell part
and keep in mind that some money is left in btc always and some in usdt always that is never touched, only added to from the $1 profit made each time

AD:
So my question would be how do you manage the crazy dumps or pumps.
When BTC goes from 100K to 120K and you already sold for a 1$ profit. 
You lost your position.
Or let’s say you only traded with 20% of your BTC and you lost 20% of the position.
How do you get back in.

Me:
there are 3 pots
I ALWAYS keep some btc

but even if I didn't, I wouldn't care. That's not the purpose of this strategy. I have an existing strategy, the one I run now, it's job is only that. 

For this strategy I sent you, if btc goes to 1 million and I'm not in it, I don't care, not even in the slightest. It's job is the fact that in any given day, week, month, btc goes through the same prices literally a million times

AD:
That’a what I wanted to say before. It has to be with only a % of your trading stash or you could lose your position and it would be nasty to get back in.

Me:
again, not concerned about keeping pace with btc value, concerned only with cash, continually making cash from btc's volatility
if I start this when 1 btc when it is at 10k and 3 years later btc is at 100k and I've only made 30k, then this strategy is a resounding success

11 days ago btc was at 112k, after going down to 108k a week before. That was 11 days ago
On Tuesday btc went to a new ATH of 126k
It's now Saturday and btc at this very moment is at 112k
overnight it went down to 101k

this strategy is for that, doing it on large time frames, doing it on small time frames, the money is split up in lots of slices. You can ignore that part, just understand that on the road from 15k to 120k, this shit touches price x, one thousand times. I'm just trying to get profit from x + $1 that one thousand times without playing myself out of position to be able to do it again lower. Higher is no problem because I'll have cash if it keeps going higher

and although I'm using btc to explain things here, I would be doing this across a bunch of things. Alts that I'm ok hodling if I get stuck with inventory. Solana is at $200, hype is at $40. So with 50k I can do a loooot of positons on those. Get it?
In just this last week or so, btc went down 18% from the top it made. Hype, went down 45%....

1 hype for $40, sell at $41
A thousand times
rinse and repeat using a pool of 50k usdt
across several alts and watching the bags with some logic to chill when the market is dropping hard (which isn't that hard)

does it make sense?

 and remember the side pots
- For every trade, I get a rebate from the dex. I get paid when my orders are filled
- Using perps instead of spot, I get paid from the funding rate
- In these dexes, your assets, USDT, BTC, etc. are automatically loaned out to leverage traders, you automatically get paid the borrowing fee  for each

couple all this together and you see, lots and lots of pennies
the only hard part is making sure to mitigate or avoid blowing all your cash buying at prices and the market dumps way down and you're stuck with that inventory

but yea, pen and paper easier to show in person

thanks for reading it and asking something
it's important to me and I appreciate it

I'm like 10% back to maybe almost considering you possibly perhaps perchance someone worth giving the privilege and honor of being allowed to help me when I have the need

AD:
Have you tested this strategy?
Why are you still on the edge?

So if this strategy can handle all these swings, why not deploy the bot and giving it a try. We might have to “pay some lesson fees” while improving the strategy,  but the best way to know is to battle test it.

This actually makes most sense as I see your bot would be diversified.

Me:
I have tests of a similar thing as bitget allows you to do it automatically but it's very simple and you have to specify the range of price, it doesn't change as the price moves, you have manually change it. It also doesn't do my multiple pot thing, nor does it have the part I want where if say 3 orders are filled then stop trading until the next 3 you would have taken would have actually closed then start trading again. Those are arbitray numbers, just trying to give you the idea

I''m going to code and test this strategy, I already know what I'm doing, I just want to get feedback as people outside of you can help you see blindspots plus improve things. So regardless I'm going to code it up and test it further, it's just a lot of work and I have another  strategy I'm currently in the middle of coding

ya, that's also at play with this strategy. These dexes give extra rewards to users who do big volume on the exchange. So this strategy if it does do lots of trades can easily push millions in a week as it's not buying and hodling, it's selling over and over so that's another few pennies right there

You see the idea right? It's not to try to predict the direction of the price, it's just a strategy to literally do anything it can to get pennies at low risk. lots of pennies. So it's not concerned with if the market takes off, I just want the pennies, the $x profit from each sell, market making rewards from the dex, receiving borrowing fees for liquidity held, rebates from the limit orders being filled, funding rate from perps

These pennies add up. The feedback needed is really around whether or not my ideas are sound for how to mitigate the HUGE risk of getting stuck when things dump and don't come back

on ftx when I was just farming by having one long and one short and collecting the funding rate, I was shocked to see that even with my small account I was doing millions of $ in volume in a month or so. And that was just me putting positions in manually. I miss ftx

So doing this automatically on a variety of time frames.... shieeet

AD:
Well, if the strategy dodges those 2 bullets then it’s bulletproof. 
You’d need to test it in a dumping and pumping market to see how it performs

Me:
ya, lots of back tests and then start small with live tests
first though I gotta code it
Talking with you and Ali so far has already got me to solidify the idea in my head while trying to explain it. It's not as complicated as I was thinking for avoiding the risky parts of it
