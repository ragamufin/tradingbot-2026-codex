### Start by
* Identify the long-term trend (~ 1 month)
* Identify the current mid-term trend (~ 2 days)
* Identify the bounds of the trend
* Identify support and resistance levels

### Entry
* When price has moved a certain amount in the direction of a trend. Enter large if it matches both the long-term and mid-term trend
* If a strong move against the mid-term trend enter small position
* When price bounces off the bounds of the trend
* Enter short at resistance, long at support
  * **NEVER** long resistance, **NEVER** short support
* Look for false breakouts where price returns to the trend, enter

### Add to position
* If already in that position and new entry signal arises, add to position, again large or small depending on the entry signal
* Give breathing room between entries so that there is space to exit in profit if there is a reversal

### Exit
* Exit when price breaks the bounds of the trend
* Trailing stops to roughly equate with the bound when in good profit
* Give room for false breakouts and support/resistance being a zone versus lines in the sand
* Set take profit points at support/resistance points
* When in small profit and the market starts confusing the fuck out of you, take the profit and exit

### Risk Management
* Being a trader = being a risk manager.
  * You will lose and lose often.
  * Playing the odds smartly is the only way to make money and avoid being rekt.
  * Risk Management is your primary focus, not entries, not exits or when to add to positions or take some off the table. You are managing risk
* Identify the minimum reward expected
* Identify the risk, i.e. the cutoff price where you should exit this trade if it goes awry
* Is the reward worth the risk?
* Size position and set stop loss in such a way that price can move against you without incurring heavy losses
* When reward appears to be great, allow more room for price to move against you with smaller positions and more breathing room between adding to position
* Easiest plays to manage risk for are shorting at resistance / longing at support with a stop just beyond or jumping in a breakout that turns out to be false
* Trade more when the mid-term and long-term trends are the same, less when they are not
* Trying to catch every move is a surefire way to get rekt
* Err on the side of capital protection, not on winning, wins come over time
* **Be patient** and play the larger reward plays, for example there is no need to short in the middle of a range when support is just a few pips away
* Make decisions based on longer time frames as there is a significantly clearer sense of what is actually happening and use shorter time frames to time entries
* **NEVER** add to losing positions in an attempt to “save” them
* huge wicks can occur at any time and can blow up your entire account. More often than not they are just temporary and things go back to normal shortly. On starter positions have stop losses for such that these wicks don’t cause you to be spending 4 hours trying to get back to break-even, take the loss. Set the stop as soon as you enter the position.
