This is no longer dip recovery plans. That view is myopic. There are always dips. This is just “Strategy” as of this date as I need to have a system to handle dips and bounces smartly, this is after all where the biggest money is made

**Before getting more coins think: should that money go into existing coins?**

### Strategy
* Trade patiently
  * **Do not fomo**
  * Protect your bottom line first and foremost, that’s the most important
  * Take small losses aplenty, do **NOT** succumb to hope while going red that it’ll come back. This is also a form of fomo
  * If you are unsure then do nothing. Waiting usually works out to be a fantastic play
* Live in Tether primarily
* Never go more than 2% in the red
* Everything is tradable for short term profits without getting out of the market entirely.
* No need to hold on to anything **unless** it is continually going up.
* Rinse and repeat trading cycles and swap out for faster moving coins where possible.
* Keep only a few coins, more money in fewer coins for greater impact from winners
* Don’t keep losers waiting for the eventual payday, e.g. ICX
* Hanging onto a winner for too long is a recipe for turning it into a loser. BTC has gone up and down for years but upward overall. Maybe one day on one of these dips it won’t come back. Take your profits, have stops (even if they are done mentally) and get back in lower or even higher but **don’t** sit and watch profits erode relying on nothing but hope.
* Don’t buy cheap, buy once they are rising, especially on a pullback.
* Hold at most 7 coins for trading
  * If a coin keeps going up, hodl until it slows down and set a stop to take profits.
  * If a coin is consistently moving well over an extended period of time then you may continue to hodl it and in this case you are ok to add another coin and go above the 7
* Monitor your watchlist, reddit, youtube, discord, etc. for interesting opportunities
* Have deadlines for movement from a coin: 1 Month.
* Until the bear is over stick primarily to the big boys
* Play alts aggressively  to make more usdt where possible
* For pairings where there is no tether you can go through btc_eth_bch_bnb_neo and buy and sell immediately through them to make sure you are tracking your value accurately.
* In a few cases, especially when a pairing tends to take turns going up and down on each other you can accumulate the big boys while **not** in a down trending market for e.g. eth_btc and bnb_btc tend to go through periods where one trends up against the other
* **IMPORTANT:** Again, aggressively take profits. You’re not trying to buddy buddy up to alts and get some super low position in them to hodl to the grave for some eventual payday 3 years from now when they may give you 100x. You, ARE, making profits where you can, as best you can, stacking up usdt (btc and eth) so it’s not necessary to catch ultimate bottoms nor ride out alts for their full potential. You, ARE, trying to catch the trending coins when they trend. **Make profits** then rinse and repeat on the plethora of opportunities out there.

Seriously, **RESIST** the temptation to stay in an alt because it is above your buy-in price and more or less going up. Profit isn’t made until it is sold. Profit is made when it is sold. If the alt is not moving relatively fast and you have no reason to believe it will again soon or it has been a while since it has then sell and move on to the next faster moving opportunity or put those funds into another existing coin that is still aggressively making gains. I would rather .5x every month than do 100x after 3 years through some tumultuous winding road through seas of red and green relying on hope/faith of that eventual payday.
* You are **not** trying to get the best, most awesome top of the market coin at the absolute bottom price. You are **not** playing Pokemon. Pick between ONT and ZRX if you will, you don’t need both, you have an embarrassment of options. If the one you pick does 15% up instead of the one you didn’t which did 100%, it’s ok. Keep the money on the side, it’s far more useful to you and buy just a few of the top alts, you don’t have to get the best of the lot, just as long as they make you more money you’re good. Your goal is to keep stacking up paper baby, little is ok, a lot is great, but the best is consistently going up.  You’ll get lucky with one of the hottest ones at some point and the good news is you’ll have lots in it to be able to truly take advantage.
* When you’d like to make an entry/exit but are in doubt, either do nothing (the best option) or split the order up and play it piece by piece. Better to win on $250 than to lose on $1000.
* There is no need to put all the money in given the above points. You’re just trying to make profits on whatever you do put in while keeping some safe on the side for other plays as well as shore ups and such.
* **IMPORTANT:** Find an efficient process, maybe TA or something, for being able to efficiently tell when to enter and exit.
* In **BEAR** markets
  * diversify amongst the big boys and things you are absolutely confident will rise from the ashes
  * A portion of your portfolio should be for batching into trades, accumulating at lower and lower prices. It’s easy money to just buy 10% of how much you would like to hold in a coin every time it goes down a fair amount and as it starts to move back up a fair amount do the same . Like this you’ll accumulate in such a way as to never be down much and yet have a strong base to be very profitable when it turns
    * Batch accumulate the big boys and hot coins.
    * Don’t try to time bottom, if it falls a lot, buy a small batch.
    * When it rises a fair amount, buy another batch.
    * Keep batches the same size as much as possible in terms of fiat keeping in mind that at lower prices that same fiat gets you more coin anyway. Things can always fall and the urge to increase batch size is a form of foam. Play the long game.
    * You can use a bigger batch size on strong upward momentums but remove some if it turns against you. Take the loss.  Don’t fuck up this strategy and end up bleeding because you were wrong on your timing. Play the long game.
  * Keep a sizable portion of your portfolio liquid
  * Trade less
  * Sell aggressively. Money is easily made in bull markets whereas most bleed profusely in bear markets. Therefore take profits in the bear because any profit made in such times is a HUGE fucking win.
* In **BULL** markets
  * Have much fewer coins with more money in each
  * Large batches
  * Watch vigilantly and take losses quickly
  * Get out once decent profit is made if better opportunities exist. Switch coins aggressively for more profitable coins
  * Anticipate the return of the bear and hedge for it by selling portions into tether taking some money off the table when you start to sense it coming. In other words, batch out of the market.
* **What** to trade
  * **The big boys**.
    * While the smaller cap coins get greater returns in a bullish maker, the big boys get greater returns in a bearish market and easier to reason about then.  Ethereum being 60% down from its average price is almost a guarantee of of 30, 40% gain once things start to turn around.
    * Alts often drop against the big boys, especially in a bearish market of when the big boys make strong moves upwards. So having some big boys allow you to have more bang for your buck when buy the smaller cap coins
  * **Hot coins**. They can be the hot coins of the moment or coins that frequently go on runs. They can be plays that seem to have a huge return for the investment made in a relatively short amount of time.
    * Batch into trades
  * **Leverage trading**. A small portion of your portfolio for leverage trading. This is simple trading but with high risk and high reward. If you can get good at this you can make big money.
    * Use small money because if you can’t turn $500 into $5000 there’s no point putting larger money in
    * Be aggressive, don’t just long, short as well.
    * Batch into trades
  * **Lottery coins**. Have a small portion of your portfolio for lottery coins. These are often super cheap, newer coins with great upside potential.
    * If you get one right you are looking at 10x or more in profit
    * the risk to reward is good, low risk but great reward
    * Buy super cheap and hodl. Use say $100 to get them and just hodl unless they die. You can have as many of these as you like if.
    * Long/Short not just btc but other coins such as bch, xrp, etc.
    * Batch into trades
* What **NOT** to trade
  * Your favorite coins if they don’t fulfill the above criteria. Is Nano a hot coin? Will you make more off Ethos than Holochain?
  * Other people’s favorite coins that don’t fulfill the above criteria. Is Ven a hot coin?
  * Coins you lost money on because you want to make back the money you lost on them, on them
  * Coins that don’t move
  * Coins that you’ve trade multiple times and always lost money on

* Again, time is on your side, use it. Be **PATIENT**
